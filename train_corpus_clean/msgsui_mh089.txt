crowds make feel
kinda struggling long remember today went shopping sister today extremely crowded mall immediately felt annoyed uncomfortable ignored could enjoy first three hours shopping stepped home started feeling maybe feel ignored earlier around people feel don’t belong i’ve always felt like weird didn’t belong world it’s crowds make realisation even worse harder brings whilst going home mood going downwards pretty badly everything became surrealistic weird everything around started make feel wasn’t supposed right shopping went visit somewhere around dinner started feel tired although slept enough previous night felt ‘out mostly don’t along smoothly ruined mood even moment stepped shopping everything started feel felt lonely misunderstood home made feel horrible felt extreme even emotions felt surreal don’t understand i’ve always felt it’s hard deal
long crowded mall come home it’s quiet feel place crowd want feel lonely

it’s normal you’re describing isn’t crazy

maybe picking hobby something enjoy alone you’ll look forward leaving mall

hope makes sense
