And as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.To live is to choose. But to choose, you must know who you are and what you stand for, where you want to go, and why you want to get there. All that is necessary to break the spell of inertia and frustration is this: Act as if it were impossible to fail.  That is the talisman, the formula, the command of right about face which turns us from failure to success. Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. Aim for success, not perfection. Never give up your right to be wrong, because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life.Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.And as we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.The future is not a result of choices among alternative pathsoffered by the present, but a place that is created - createdfirst in the mind and will, created next in activity. The futureis not some place we are going to, but one we are creating. Thepaths are not to be found, but made, and the activity of makingthem, changes both the maker and the destination.Every decision you make - every decision - is not a decision about what to do. It's a decision about Who You Are. When you see this, when you understand it, everything changes. You begin to see life in a new way. All events, occurrences, and situations turn into opportunities to do what you came here to do.
