hope correct place helps

seeing current doctor little less year think gradually switched clinic first doctor

fantastic first doctor spoke depression even scheduled appointment shift could spend time feel comfortable talking feel like respects decisions simply matter doctor would stay without question

unfortunately becoming rather expensive super cheap insurance covers nothing i’ve sick couple times year multiple office visits time plus checkups finding antidepressant works insurance therapy bills it’s getting

much like wondering switch doctors opportunity check direct care doctors monthly charge would half i’ve paid year wouldn’t worry racking another every time step office would also spend time doctor less time waiting room

idea talking doctors makes nervous don’t know easy would find another doctor comfortable

also feel really guilty idea changing doctors like said current doctor great gone helpful unfortunately clinic works isn’t great costs feeling rather high

going talk therapist tomorrow recommended doctor good relationship hoping outside points view thanks reading
