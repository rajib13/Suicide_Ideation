it’s uncommon nightmares consecutive nights multiple times night sometimes dreams tell screaming sleep cannot remember details every nightmare recent forest full giant snakes family caught ground giant snake moving towards called couldn’t hear even though right attacked woke maybe it’s nothing many nightmares

hard time speaking group three people including around people know pretty normal anyone can’t think days cringing said matter small usually think people think based said like “wow dude thinks smart really isn’t” stuff like brings next issues remember vividly cringy things past without consciously something breath like hate myself” “nigger” think shock outta using slang nothing race happens quite frequently times

think greatest childhoods either grandma lost life depression suicide know much affected hardly remember much either babysitter parents working would happiest moments life happened daycare days think make months later grandma died cancer remember staying house apparent cared older brother younger sister remember vividly picked older brother constantly would take phone matter hard would struggle always would read messages girls make brutal fucking hell awkward preteen parents never would help never around always teased picked bullied beat fucking butt fucking joke side spectrum tried pull shit sister life goes cycles asshole would immediately punished would grounded phone taken away locked room matter benign comment
