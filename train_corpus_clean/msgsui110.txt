best worked four days hated training workers impatient going apply grocery stores even back mcds least easy dont time massive learning curve need money family mean parents siblings find furious even though what’s best know quitting overextending make right decision
went crazy fiancé lost everything work stop friends series random women sleep doesn’t fill void can’t seem make friends even move soon gone year feel empty alone sand scared taking vacation soon women sleeping offered thinking ending christmas since going won’t good thing tired relying temporary relationships make don’t either relationship idea makes sadder don’t want don’t balls either tired nothing brings anymore wanted vent tell someone i’ve thinking killing without affecting friends don’t want pity
dont want kill point feels like slow steady march cliff matter hard cant horrible spot universe life hold long thanks nasty combination mental illness luck watch sidelines tears friends enjoy life finding love pursuing higher education enjoying freedom earning money looks amazing childhood bedroom insane highly dysfunctional deeply alone
dont really feel like anymore whoever dont want anymore fucking hate life thought friends relatives sobbing funeral doesnt make feel guilty point scares point usual evening wanting wake tomorrow wont drive parking garage always think jump
really hope find want fall love

save breath trying persuade otherwise already made mind fucking piece shit call life
wondering less painful
