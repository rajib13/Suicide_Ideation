anyone know normal times extreme stress lose sight past future

seem lost touch memories carried entire life feel shallow also seem almost exclusively focus present almost like years life following past year never happened force remember anything force remember past think really happened really bizarre used rich vivid memory struggle even remember life moments theres nearly emotion attached

past week also short term memory issues felt completely isolated even around people feel like forgotten socialize behave like mentally separate universe everyone else even though physically trying skate

basically dealing insane level stress cant escape years starting year stopped feeling like felt lately described become almost debilitating point question competent anymore cant think normally could internalized stress cause kind stuff time would recover
doctor whatsoever post sounds single word doesnt textbook example feeling read dissociative identity disorder stating remotely even suffer every symptom help catch youre experiencing explaining certain things sound like traits revolve around

dont worry though find match dont negativity manifest point convince able accurately diagnose cant take information understanding experiences necessary explaining professional continues causing distress
research today dont think thats really dealing lead digging found cognitive dysfunction sounds like dealing issue finding causing know stress shuts prefrontal cortex cognitive function takes place also battling addiction yearswhich also weakens prefrontal cortex combination high stress already weak brain causing symptoms

rereading wrote yesterday dont know really explained well either good hear someone relate level crap screwed right wish knew going

guess going beat addiction work stress things clear

thanks
