flat tire tried change everything could wrong went wrong took hour minutes change tire finally began driving home hearing weird noise thought could leak walked around back noticed spare almost flat tried google closest stations near hoping spare phone died soon told minutes away” drive knew machine order kept driving found another parked counted pennies hope found quarter counted change ended cents short broke already crying different desperate noise making drove scary afraid maybe tire would spark catch fire fall apart afraid would completely undrivable home backing parking space someone honked idea made pulling parking someone almost guess pulled screamed bloody murder even though weren’t close crying repeating needed cents” driving home finally home walked door husband downstairs could needed cents” guess shock pure anxiety part could phrase able tell backseat park tire went flat headed upstairs repeating phrase minutes able finally stop shower stopped crying laid

awake next morning event didn’t seem horrible it’s like anyone severely hurt warranty tire that’s good makes nervous never hopeless crisis dependent others guess people give strength whenever there’s issue usually jump lend helping hand solve problem super ready change tire soon nuts tight lost actual tire wouldn’t come lost tried grabbing tire pulling metal sticking tire couldn’t stabbed cried like child
