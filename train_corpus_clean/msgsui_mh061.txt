lost getting worse
anyone reading willing give advice want thank

feel like longer know since young never felt good enough would always compare others regardless would feel inferior

guess started changing self improvement discipline kind meditation reading

would actually start changing deep character didnt like someone something would force like didnt feel confident would fake felt unhappy would force happy feeling dumb would force feel smart usually overthinking things thought thats smart people think

would basically mask time feel like lost become dependant masks without anxious stressed especially around people

feel like mask personality identity views world differently gotten point feel like mask would like certain thing another mask would hate exact thing varies food entertainment people hobbies life goals spoken people seen around different councillors none particularly helpful leave feeling good couple days cycle begins start thinking mask personality given situation

given advice ignore stop thinking personalities tried feeling flat lousy days

used mask shifting personality thing advantage well though like times studying subject studying boring accounting decided change mask personality knew enjoyed subject like pressing switch felt like different person person able look study notes like magic suddenly understood even enjoyed

thing goes food sports even people could conversation someone know current personality mask doesnt along well would change personality mask someone know interact well strange feeling like cant connect form meaningful connection anyone relationship depends less personality

every time change mask personality feel like person start personality reason change around would feel like completely different person point onwards would feel like wasnt even beginning would longer personality mask

happening many years around 7ish years feel getting worse worse getting confused time goes years seriously holding back

anyone advice would appreciate tremendously havent able find anything else relating feeling currently none councillors therapists able either

even whilst writing personality changed result writing style changed adjusted title previous personality liked current didnt thought would change

confusing

thank taking time read
