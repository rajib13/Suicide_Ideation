honestly don’t think friends i’ve helping
much supporting much really even care i’ve
living parents since graduated aren’t
happy today deal yelled
never felt pain hurt
alone depression psychosis suck i’ve battling
many desperate years turns can’t matter
hard tired pretending tired making others
happy forget issues
