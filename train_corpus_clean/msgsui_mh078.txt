antidepressants supposed
i’ve professionally diagnosed bipolar past years i’ve tried different antidepressantsantipsychoticsmood stabilizers i’ve always wondered what’s supposed like antidepressants work nothing’s ever helped chronic suicidal ideation wits currently lithium trazodone feel like it’s made everything worse drugs help suicidal ideation keep going therapy also therapist sick feeling suicidal sure
prescription drugs help thing drugs youre taking drugs interfere easy find drug work might find certain drug work along another much like trying decode lock many possible combinatioms said sometimes isnt medication alleviate enough pain experience therapy important like drugs also easy find right therapist therapy treatment talk therapy never worked currently going without though desperately need something akin emdr assuming closest friends bipolar uses cannabis also needs therapy tough maze figure worth trying multiple options
started prozac first antidepressant worked great lucky

felt like awake could experience world without getting overwhelmed exhausted shut stopped snapping people loved wanted active grades great everything working well wasnt totally normal newfound energy better attitude incredibly helpful

changed things body teen able drink whole bottle vodka without dying even getting nauseous prozac stomach waaay sensitive normal started drinking like normal person couldnt binge without feeling sick body started curbing dangerous habits also lost weight thought awesome never wanted prozac even still eating kind rough want throw time

point life though things going okay little later series shitty circumstances happened progress made undone prozac longer enough keep afloat think thats circumstances environment shit time youre huge amount stress youre abused antidepressants help much theyre part puzzle found environment huge factor

ended hospital started getting prescribed antipsychotics ones remember taking depakote risperidone seroquel abilify none helpful instructed ahead keep taking prozac good effects would dulled antipsychotics risperidone gave really reaction couldnt think heart beating obscenely fast couldnt drive couldnt walk room another without stumbling horrible

fast forward prozac consistently whole time longer take anything else well marijuana wouldnt necessarily recommend dont feel great first started think thats effect going hardships definitely feel difference miss days prozac

prozac better circumstances helpful combination ever experienced
sounds extremely familiar years ages 1924 probably took like different meds combinations meds nothing others made manic hospitalized

eventually asked worked sucks slipped started transcranial magnetic stimulation shit treatment resistant stuff took suicidal content month side effects thirty minute treatment every weeks year

psychiatrist nonpharmaceutical options dont theyre shitty dinosaur shrink
