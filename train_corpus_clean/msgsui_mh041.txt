benzo withdrawal sucks wouldn’t recommend

zeal wean lamictal didn’t occur taper xanax instead took remaining pills course days disposed bottle could would experience withdrawal didn’t occur symptoms descended

wasn’t quick recognize strangeness withdrawal stoked anxiety experienced topsyturvy perceptions reality—that’s best describe “topsyturvy” everything felt offkilter somehow even visual perception shifted imagine consuming thirty cappuccinos loaded espresso much caffeine made “reality” appear experiencing camera foggy lens gain cranked high600pxsuddeninvoluntarychemicalwithdrawaloiloncanvas120x120cm2016my heart raced nonstop often felt dizzy lightheaded took last xanax found almost impossible fall asleep night wake every hour struggle coax back sleep

mood shifted found irritable depressed humor suicidal thought every feelings worthlessness consumed felt distant almost alien everyone encountered

it’s hard articulate felt something wedged “reality” felt disconnected disinterested instead living thinking planning coasted life point next moment next detached oblivious

nothing mattered nothing even shivering hands arms bothered appetite vanished force small portions—and didn’t care body temperature went haywire around time moment felt cold next felt desert dressed winter

freaked something must seriously wrong thought googled symptoms applied myriad diseases wondered much caffeine caused skewed vision perception switched beverages zero caffeine sugar diet didn’t improve

death thought dying something wrong heart arteries enough blood oxygen making brain

didn’t mention word this—my thoughts state—to anyone didn’t seek outside opinion rational point view instead allowed anxiety thoughts state devour another seemingly neverending feedback loop

every night lying imagine dying sleep waking disappearing nothingness every morning waking break lamictal half swallow

fear

occurred xanax

didn’t taper quit cold turkey



desperation honest poverty imposed crushed vague attempt conquer flee made irrational decision—another thing poverty inspires irrational thinking
