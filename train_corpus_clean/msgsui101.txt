reason havent bullet head grown indifferent become lazy workaholic parent house till work wait next morning dont shit worthwhile wasting lifetime potential used kinds cool shit pull slump always point give less anxiety accept going ever make feel like posting wasting good intentioned peoples time concern wish time motivation express gratitude people deserve grandparents passed wasnt realized much wish couldve told wish could theyd proud still around going make next year hope alcohol keeps around longer theres still part gives shit cant bring anymore

would ecstatic fear fucking life caring anything could whatever want bound wait illness take
poof problems disappear wouldnt able worry anything like blessing

watching people social media time without makes want kill

dont anything anymore dont enjoy anything nobody speaks really important anyone close killing enough really
dont know else cant evicted help tried everything

waited long enough hurt never gets better
wont missed much barely friends family fine without sure
wish could made better mark world right annoying pathetic nobody likes
sorry everybody disappointment
love greater good trust

thats message going leave behind finally killing irony poetic
