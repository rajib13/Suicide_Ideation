like think kind responsible fair lead happy life we’re wrong nice guys really finish last study published nature human behavior suggests value economic equity brain’s core likely depressed prefer everything tend happier

according model “social value orientation” humans placed three rough categories based reactions economic inequity people prosocials meaning prefer resources distributed equally among everyone individualists meaning primarily concerned maximizing resources roughly competitive important outcome people

2010 masahiko haruno suggested nature neuroscience primal brain structures like amygdala “lie core prosocial orientation” research group found exposed economic inequity prosocials strong activation amygdala evolutionally ancient region brain associated automatic feelings stress simulation others received money received prosocial amygdalae activated received money others simulation amygdala activation suggesting automatic feelings stress guilt individualists hand strong amygdala activation victims inequity individualist amygdala relatively unfazed individualist unfairly money another person groups amygdalae sensitive victims prosocials uniquely sensitive economic inequity benefitted financially guilty amygdalae
study published nature human behavior month haruno’s group took question whether prosocial pattern brain activation correlated longerterm clinical symptoms depression examined brains prosocials individualists using functional magnetic resonance imaging imaging technique allows neuroscientists areas brain activated specific situations

expected prosocials high amygdala activity exposed situations money unequally distributed true whether received money others others received money individualists increased amygdala activation others received money additional finding study hippocampus another primitive brain region involved automatic stress responses also showed different pattern activity prosocials individualists

patterns brain activity associated depression researchers used common depression questionnaire called beck depression inventory beck measures symptoms clinical depression within past weeks taking survey haruno’s group found prosocial pattern brain activation associated depression also true followed participants year later psychiatrists long suggested certain personality characteristics including extreme empathy propensity toward feeling guilt associated developing depression study showed sensitivity deepest primal automatic parts brain

hope lost prosocials mauricio delgado neuroscientist rutgers university says although average prosocial sensitive amygdala hippocampus primal stress related brain region study plenty higherorder brain regions involved depression including prefrontal cortex brain region associated regulation automatic feelings delgado says authors study point prosocials take advantage psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral therapy teach better control primal responses inequity prefrontal cortex inhibit amygdaladriven stress less likely become depressed

also important note participants study eighteen twentysix researchers shown prefrontal cortex fully mature around twentysix ongoing research haruno exploring findings apply older adults fully developed prefrontal cortices hope fully developed prefrontal cortices protect older adults inequitydriven depressionoverall findings slightly disheartening prosocials also seen opportunity prosocials prone experiencing guilt stress faced economic inequity seems wired deepest automatic structures brain training higherlevel brain processes like prefrontal cortex prosocials learn control emotions fight depression psychotherapy likely core sensitivity inequity drive kind behavior strength keep emotions check fight depression prosocials need work fight depression i—and sure prosocials—will rooting
