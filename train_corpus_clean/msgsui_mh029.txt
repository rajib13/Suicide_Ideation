pathetic neet living years feel stuck much happened period runins police psychiatric hospital stretch time exgirlfriend almost strangled death burned bridges dealing fucking disease

fighting madness inside head since march 2016 call alignment problem signs life march 2016 particularly stressful time thats spiraled control

context always felt fully immersed present moment like theres something need finish truly enjoy experience imagine want unwind relax finish work assignment report theres hanging presence unfinished business constantly following around finish thats felt like life like truly relaxed something need finish first

thing need finish destroyed describe optimization process alignment process feels like straighten core forefront reality able live freely relax without feeling presence unfinished business

march 2016 felt urge straighten decided first time start work unfinished business align refer alignment often using term literal sense picture dark cavernous space bubble inside directly located center bubble felt urge fully aligned symmetrical literal visual sense wasnt wouldnt able move forward life

often visualize dark cavernous space hours needed remember times needed centered times initial visualizations intellectualized approach would actually prove center

started like thisin center mean exactly make true eventually came word important want truly centered become important person universe egotistical reason purely sake alignment symmetry

came list arbitrary facts world tried maneuver grand truth universe could prove significance finally become centered every part knew untrue knew wasnt universally significant needed true practically forced true days days weeks months forced remember every significant fact prove worthy alignment symmetry

months consciousness fucking rattled almost extent numerous psychedelic trips felt like planet three straight months forcing untrue drivel reality repeating incessantly three straight months looping thoughts desperately trying find center

developed derealization moods became incredibly erratic paranoia longer planet earth

period realized would able align forcing absurd truths existence figured want center center using facts spent another four months trying unravel true nature reality thought could understand world around well morality finally aligned strong justification actions moving forward

four months went another long stretch time trying accomplish impossible trying answer every question known symmetry life longer anything prove lost alignment problem began seep every facet life whether fitness speaking family friends organizing home literally everything became issue symmetry balance

everything needed right

summer year started realize maybe theres solution maybe gone point developed severe delusions probably stemming months obsessive thoughts ruminations

finally psychiatrist month apparently schizophrenic makes sense think theres prescribed risperdal havent really taken state chaos right nearly years repeating thoughts fucking alignment cant take anymore

part thinks shouldnt take medication force mind might accelerate overdrive mode automatically revert back normal desperately hoping want back normal

dont know wrote post frankly thinking killing exgirlfriend thoughts like time real want kill film became famous maybe kill cant take repeating thoughts anymore cant anymore cant want

said think would away could solve fucking alignment problem maybe doesnt like

guess want sound like would antipsychotics even help situation gone even worth anymore awake nearly hours struggling point living anymore dont know please help tell something help
