depressive friend
know isnt thing fixing mental illness want ways help friend really knocked life

positive talented person total wreck unable sustain

kinda really told friends life amazing sudden destroys everything liked life reason

mother never around help lacked father basically alone time friends ended moving somewhere else leaving

emotions saying shouldnt learn anything emotions saying dont ideas made emotions take like child

nowadays obese woman hates secretary heavy gear business along shown talents hobbies

pretty good artist keeps going self hate speeches starts hearing present emotions anything else infuriates somebody talented wasting away delusions useless

aggressive starts getting saying going abandon hate reality dont hate hate defective side

dont know feel like giving abandoning point everyday telling something problems really pissed ended talking days

delicate full thorns lost alot potential friends behaviour feel like next
sound like great friend please remember take care well wellbeing important

sorry comes across rude it’s take care time huge difference supportive friend starts effect wellbeing anyway become quite problematic isn’t therapy strongly recommend she’ll probably fight first hopefully she’ll it’s best thing
sounds much like experience honestly therapy especially huge benefit people similar symptoms

cant help kind understanding also protecting psychological fatigue might suggesting therapy ultimately need take care first
