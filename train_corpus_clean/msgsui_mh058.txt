brothers hospital sending home without schizophrenia medication edge month
unfortunately know first hand much hearing older brother diagnosed autism schizophrenia diagnosed schizophrenia twenty years clozapine overwhelmingly worked despite occasional relapses mother said unbearable clozapine would constantly kicked placements last placement walked away several miles house tell mother workers pulled knife started caring years

every couple years longer brother would relapse would start obsessing something like weather obama difficult understand exactly concern would talk hard understand specifically obsessing something upset days week eventually would culminate large incident police would called witnessed happen banged head vacuum told police someone else home attacked typical personality would psychiatric hospital days come back perfectly normal fine

another incidents happened month started obsessing something making word soup claimed thrown meds guess werent really meds however hospital sent home without clozapine gave depakote abilify instead ages brother insisted doesnt schizophrenia said occasionally finding ways take meds week time also claimed hospital doesnt think schizophrenia wont give clozapine

past month living hell relapses police arriving gone years longer event happening least four times past month attempted suicide twice downplaying everything else sleeping hours every single night hasnt eating pounding walls claiming pacing house making everyone anxious edge yelling making accusations constantly constantly picking fights telling another relative know relative isnt telling contacts online work google government telling

control things getting really scary hospital seemingly isnt taking seriously idea live states away family dealing every single
occurred brought mother liked idea biggest issue nearest hospital seems like several hours away since recently moved major metropolitan area northern texas would need figure talk brother cooperating staying calm issue absolutely convinced doesnt schizophrenia medication unfortunately suspect convinced doctors since told werent giving complicated blood draws would much hassle regular blood draws years without issue
best refute live schizophrenia document everything told video audio recordings possible police show next share documentation request assistance rerouting useful hospital save time resources
thats horrible would suggest different mental hospital finding make sure isnt able happen future setting type communication relatives live placepeople treat brother
