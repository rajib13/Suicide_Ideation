first session today
cant help feel little skeptical though talking therapy weeks dont think helped much

telephone appointments honestly dont gonna help either guess pretty desperate though things change time feel like getting told things already know anxiety problems years know whole works wish would stop

hopefully someone give hope positive experience youve
came across little like think nothing resolve threw selfhelp books exposure therapy pretty much everything dunno experiences doctors seen less meds leave tell thing time anxiety works emotion theres extra help involved

think worth hence asking positive experiences people criticised instead
youve anxiety problems years sessions talking therapy sure expected talking therapy theyre processes take time make even area life even tiny better worth surely
advice give stick matter feel feel dont need want anymore stay stopped awhile reasons ended going back help takes time
