considering going formal therapy
gestions
everyday feel lonely
since past sometime think panic attacks really need
help guys
many years feel still can’t move noticing
behavior could considered “triggers”
know never meant lead life
don’t want hurt people care can’t take anymore
today felt nothing left even living don’t
point
kill part tells waste
money parents invested
