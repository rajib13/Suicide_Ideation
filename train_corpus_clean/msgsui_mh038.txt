“what know don’t” friend chris often jokingly asks aware conspiracy others know understand

aren’t conspiracies–at least barcodes concerned know turn obscure hide every barcode sight aesthetic reasons can’t stand look don’t know find aesthetically unappealing since upcs ubiquitous society spend time care admit hiding destroying ignoring

reason pictured scene–and holds true today–my father absent image always depicted woman alone enveloped snow perhaps deemphasized father’s presence told story perhaps unnecessary imagery perhaps enamored mother focal point conjuring memory write still don’t picture father scene instead envision humanshaped waft black gray smoke drifting alongside mother

depressive realism although endorsed plurality cognitive scientists it’s notion people depressive states tend perceive “reality” accurately people it’s hypothesis great importance—perhaps philosophers psychologists people filter information myriad cognitive biases it’s incontrovertible people aren’t depressed hypothesis argues perceive reality positive biases enables nonconsciously filter bleak negative facets human condition human experience “when you’re smiling whole world smiles too” song goes people locked depressive states tend filter information positive lenses cases glimpse world ought

hypothesis verified empirical studies—and since deals “nature” “reality” probably leave philosophy however think nothing anecdotal evidence hypothesis holds water

unfortunately didn’t realize that’s something people don’t suffer depression often overlook you’re depressed seriously depressed suicidally depressed don’t always realize you’re depressed object behavior flaw grabs attention focus almost exclusively point obsession juxtapose situation someone else’s situation fixate behavior perceived flaw fixations obsessions define mood you’re concerned eventually you’re lucky you’ll find “aha” moment realize state preceded fixations—ie fixations didn’t define mood mood established fixations

it’s critical realize people depressed don’t always realize they’re depressed certainly didn’t didn’t realize extent depression allencompassing induced anxiety mania routine performed night night benefit hindsight know playing russian roulette didn’t perceive risks time fact elated never produced much work interesting imagery short amount time



brief interlude

wrote novels back back mental state deteriorated locked severe depression tetrasect anxiety mania depression sleep deprivation transformed hollow world dimmed everything reminded ashes color drained universe felt hopeless lost world universe life seemed empty devoid substance
