years living world seen true happiness overwhelming sorrow burning question going head time writing move barely single teardrop anymore everything seems pointless fantasy ends real life begins driving prelude producing short films whatnot girl side thats head think trying achieve image something calls whats behind ever come back ever find true love others without trapped sorrow want drive night forever someone ever find attractive knows maybe life supposed harmful happy time fulfil dreams death seems attractive times take life miss feeling much question left unanswered
believe love dreamy love
fuck anti depressants numb cant feel life supposed
past year telling inadequate failure nothing worked self positivity joke seem like happy surface bottling emotions life year surfaced fact self esteem confidence doesnt help today first considered want better seems like things going hill please help

wanted tell someone finally going kill tomorrow depressed thinking suicide last years angry everything
actually dying fucking scared dont want suffer slow painful death last moments hospital much better kill still chance least choose scared death terrified pain dont want experience

time stressed sometimes vision killing time control rest time actively worrying making worse
anyone else anything like
particularly stressful months getting tired able rationally think situation moment going either point

nothing life matters anymore people could ever open either done good reason ruin everything theyre busy making want talk basically butting lives disrupting everything
addition anyone truly confide hate zero prospects everything found nothing appeals hobby works tried start many empty
dont fulfilling life hell dont even decent best make sure people family friends dont deal constant negative attitude leave
