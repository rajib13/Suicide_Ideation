want feel abandoned must idiot
hope random event kill nobody
guilty loved ones would mourn would move
least easier actively killed
times brain seems shut calm
panic anything think
iety feel like nothing mine don’t genuinely don’t
remember time felt normal
theres terrible feeling whole body every waking
moment theres ways ending hasnt
getting better worse freaking
thing stopping dont know abouthave access anything
would make quick clean
