Top of FormI'm not really sure why I'm posting this, maybe just to get it written out. I don't really want help and I'm sorry if it's a bit long.I am a firm believer that there are aspects of ourselves that we can know with certainty and that others can't or shouldn't question. For instance, if someone decided that they know, deep down with unwavering certainty that they are a Christian or a Jew or vegetarian we accept that. If someone comes out as gay we accept that they know this about themselves to be the absolute truth. I give these examples to illustrate a point. I know, with every fiber of my being that I shouldn't be alive, I'm not supposed to be here and I want to die very badly. I've had this conscious thought since I was 10 years old and every day since then has been torture.I have tried in the past to get therapy thinking that something is wrong with me and I could be fixed. Every single time has been an unmitigated disaster. Fear of being incarcerated in a mental health facility (which has happened the 1 and only time I ever expressed my suicidal thoughts) has kept me from opening up and as a result any counseling I've gotten over the years has been frustratingly pointless as mental health professionals refuse to even entertain the idea that I know I shouldn't be alive.I'm not a religious person but I still pray every day because if there is a non zero chance that god exists I can't afford to miss that opportunity. I pray every time I go to sleep that I never wake up and each time I do I get more and more frustrated. I pray for the strength to take matters into my own hands and every time I lose my nerve I hate myself a little bit more. But I still pray and force myself to really believe that each sleep will be my last.Maybe the frustration is just latent will to live draining away and one day, if god doesn't do it for me, I'll finally be able to do what should have been done decades ago. Honestly, the hope of death is the only thing keeping me from madness.Bottom of Form
