I'll try to keep this brief. Every time I go after something that I want or something that will make me happy it falls apart and blows up in my face. Girlfriends all eventually leave me. Everything falls apart. I see friends who have it easy who just are able to live life happy and have these things that make them happy. Why not me? How come my life has to be so goddamned hard? I'm so sick of it. I'm so sick of not being allowed to have a life. Everytime I try, shit falls to pieces. Every. Time.I have no job. I owe money that I don’t have to pay off fines to get my drivers license back. Everything in my life is broken and has been for a long time. Any time I've tried to make it better it just gets worse. Like I'm fucking cursed. I'm so goddamn sick of it. I'm sick of the heartbreak and I'm sick of the struggle.I'm sick of being broken and leading a broken life. Everything has blown up in my face and I've just failed over and over. I'm really done with it all. I need a positive change NOW or I really don't see a future for myself. I just don't know what to do.Life feels so fucking unfair. Like why me? This is my one and only life, how come it had to be so fucked up? Why me? I was poor AF growing up and still pretty much am. I had plans to go to college but a clerical error happened with my financial aid and it was too late to fix it so I couldn’t attend. WHY did that error have to happen to me?I had an awesome job that I loved and I worked at for 2 years until I got “randomly selected” to be laid off. Again, I have the absolute shittiest luck in the world apparently.My friends even joke about my terrible luck. How nothing goes right for me. And it doesn't. Like ever. I'm so sick of it. I'm sick of everything being harder for me than everyone else. I'm sick of struggling. I'm sick of it all.I just want to cry. I don't want to keep doing this and I don't want to be around anymore. It's not fucking fair. I don't fucking get it. I hate it. And now I'm backed into a corner with no other options. I had so many dreams and hopes and things I wanted to do but evidently all that is never going to happen.I'm so sick of life and this fucked up world and everything just going wrong for me. It sucks. I try to be a good person but that doesn't matter. This world is cruel and I'm starting to wish I'd never been born into it. Fuck this place.
