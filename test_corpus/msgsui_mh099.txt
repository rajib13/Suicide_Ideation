i believe i am a sociopath
ive always been afraid to write about this but here goes. but my sociopathic tendencies arise from girls

basically my whole life i've needed a girlfriend to feel whole, to feel positive emotions such as love and happiness and i'll do anything to acquire those emotions. i feel dead inside without them. if my friends or family died i would feel nothing unless the girls texts me, then i feel such intense feelings of remorse sadness and depression and missing the person. someone to talk to me every day. it makes me feel less lonely. i feel so empty without one

when a girl doesn't text me back the emotional reaction i feel is unreal. every second of every day is controlled by the text. i cannot focus on anything. i will starve myself the entire day. if a friend or family member dies i don't care unless the girl is taking to me. if they're talking to me i feel regular emotions of sadness and depression and missing the person. tbh without the reply if they die i would feel nothing. i need their friendship as a way to get approval myself. if a friend stops talking to me i literally go insane into panic attack mode. l call their phone 10 times. text them why do you hate me are you still my friend what did i do. but the ultimate reason i'm doing this is not because i care about them but because i need the friendship or i cannot survive. unless i'm talking to the girl, then the genuine emotions of love and friendship come back and i love them again and don't need it

i feel like my sociopathic tendencies lie in this part of my post. like i said without girls i feel no positive emotion for anyone. close friends, family, if they died i would not care. but when they're talking to me i love them more than anything in the world. so when the girl stops talking to me i go crazy. it feels like my like is over and they'll never talk to me again so i'll make up situations to force a reply. i'll text them my family member died and i need someone to talk to. i'll make up a situation where my car ran out of gas and i need them pick me up. this is all seems sociopathic but the things is i only do this because i want the approval of the girl. and i want to feel fucking positive emotions for my friends. it's such bullshit to lie to them and tell them i care about them when if they died i wouldn't care at all unless the girl is talking to me. once i get the approval of the girl i don't do any of these things, it's just when then stop texting me back and my mind freaks out and determines it as if they're never going to talk to me again so i must make up ridiculous scenarios to force a reply. i consider myself a horrible person so if you want to comment on that i don't mind. i've been scared to post about this for the longest time but i need to know. thank you
You might want to do a little research on personality disorders (sociopaths are one type, called antisocial personality disorder, along a spectrum of PDs). Usually that diagnosis is characterized by a lack of empathy in the extreme; does that sound like you?

Better yet, see a therapist or psychologist. What youâ€™re describing sounds very distressing for you and that warrants getting help, and perhaps he or she will be able to sort out the meaning and roots of your need for validation from a romantic interest.
