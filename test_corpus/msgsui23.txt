Hey I'm having issues finding any real hope for staying alive. I work in agriculture and over the last year I have been having suicidal thoughts for 2 reasons.1) I hate the grad school I'm at. 2) I can't find hope for the future of humanity because of climate change.I have dealt with the first one by expediting my research so I can get my masters degree which is good so I can start working on a degree in ag. education which is what I want to work in.The second is a bigger issue. I can't avoid the issue of climate change because it affects everything in the field I work. It seems like that if we continue at the rate of which we send out CO2 then humanity as we know it will no longer exist. This never leaves my mind and no matter how much help I get from group and from personal therapy.I would like to be happy again yet still know the issues we face in the environment. I see my fellow colleges with kids and hopes for careers and they know just as much about environmental issues if not more then I do. I just want to be happy but its just hard to get this out of my mind or to deal with it in a healthy way.I have no real vices as I see getting drunk, smoking, doing drugs, etc. as a way of not dealing with the issue. Also to be honest many things are going very well in my life, I'm going to be applying to a new school for a degree in what I want to do, I'm healthy, I'm in good shape, I think I'm a good looking guy, etc. but I just can't deal with the thought of a doomed future.Pleas help or give advice thank you.
