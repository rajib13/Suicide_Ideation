This little dare devil’s name is Hunter, and he turned 11 in October. Today my mom told me he hasn’t really been eating or moving since before thanksgiving.

When I put my key in the ignition and turn it, my car let’s out two small beeps of the horn. Never had this happen before. Any idea what’s going on?
