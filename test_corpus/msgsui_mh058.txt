My brother's hospital has been sending him home without his schizophrenia medication and he's been on edge for a month.
In the U.S. Unfortunately some of this I know first hand, much of this I'm hearing about. So my older brother is diagnosed with autism and schizophrenia. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia twenty years ago. He has been on clozapine, which has overwhelmingly worked, despite occasional relapses. Our mother said he was unbearable before being on the clozapine and would constantly be kicked out of placements. The last placement he was in, he walked away from and several miles to our house to tell our mother one of the workers pulled a knife on him. So my mom had started caring for him. This was about ten years ago.

So about once every couple years or longer, my brother would have a relapse where he would start obsessing over something odd, like the weather or Obama and it was difficult to understand exactly what his concern was. I would sit down with him and talk to him, but he was very hard to understand specifically when he was obsessing about something that upset him. After a few days or a week of this, eventually it would culminate in a large incident where the police would be called. I witnessed this happen when he banged his head on a vacuum and told the police someone else in the home had attacked him. This was NOT typical for his personality. He would go to the psychiatric hospital for a few days and come back perfectly normal and fine.

Another one of these incidents happened about a month ago where he started obsessing over something, making word soup, and he claimed to have thrown out his meds, which I guess weren't really his meds. However, the hospital sent him home without his clozapine and gave him depakote and abilify instead. For ages, my brother has insisted he doesn't have schizophrenia and said he'd been occasionally finding ways to not take his meds for a week at a time. He also claimed the hospital doesn't think he has schizophrenia and that is why they won't give him clozapine.

So for the past month, it has been a living hell. Relapses and the police arriving have gone from being a once in two years or longer event to happening at least four times in the past month. He attempted suicide twice and then has been downplaying that and everything else. He's been sleeping two hours at the most every single night. He hasn't been eating. He's been pounding on the walls and claiming he's not. He's been pacing the house. He's been making everyone anxious and on edge. Yelling and making accusations constantly. Constantly picking fights and telling me that another relative is out to get him, when I know that relative isn't. He's been telling me his contacts online who work for Google or the government are telling him this and that.

This has been out of control, and things are getting really scary. The hospital seemingly isn't taking this seriously and I have no idea what to do. I live a few states away, but my family is dealing with this every single day. What can they do?
That occurred to me and I brought it up with my mother. She liked the idea. The biggest issue is the other nearest hospital seems like it may be several hours away since they recently moved from a major metropolitan area to Northern Texas. We would need to figure out how to talk my brother into cooperating and staying calm. One issue with this is he's absolutely convinced he doesn't have schizophrenia and the medication is bad for him. Unfortunately, I suspect he's convinced his doctors of that since they told my mom they weren't giving it to him because "it's complicated," and that the blood draws would be too much hassle. My mom has been doing the regular blood draws for ten years without issue.
Best way to refute that he does not live with schizophrenia is to document everything you told us here. Video or audio recordings if possible. When the police show up next, share documentation with them and request their assistance in rerouting him to a useful hospital. It will save them time and resources too.
Thats horrible! I would suggest a different mental hospital and finding a way to make sure that this isnt able to happen again in the future by setting up some type of communication between your relatives that live with him and the place/people that treat your brother.
