Do I have impostor syndrome?
I don't have the "fear" of being discovered as a "fraud" - at least not rationally. Instead, I consider myself a pretty confident man. However, some traits resembles me this issue.

I always studied a lot. Consider myself being born very intelligent, yes, but also studied a lot during my life. Considering this, last week I felt bad about having the opportunity to go to college and have those amazing experiences, while many people couldn't. I felt guilty because I had an opportunity my parents hadn't.

Regarding money, I am a pretty economical and also work hard. However, I don't feel good when thinking I'm gonna get rich.

Another example. After being the nerd guy in school and having a very lonely adolescence with no friends, I've worked hard on socializing in the last two years. I'm way better now, and results are coming. I made some friends and also started to engage with girls for the first time in my life. And suddenly, when I have a date with a beautiful and kind woman, started to feel like it isn't the right thing to do, since not every man on earth could date such a wonderful girl.

Considering this, do I have impostor syndrome?

TL;DR: I work hard on my activities, but when I achieve success, I don't feel good, considering how much luck I had - which many other people don't. I feel like I don't deserve it.
