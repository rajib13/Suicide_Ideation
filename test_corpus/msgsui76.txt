This is kind of long so I will try and hit the key points and not jump all over the place. A bit of backstory. My daughter is 14, 15 in January. She has a pretty good life I think, we are part of the rapidly dying middle class so although she attends private school in LA and sees kids with way way more money and things than she has I don't think it matters much to her and she really wants for nothing. She is not abused, her mother and I are still married and still ove each other and we give her tons of love, support, attention etc. She has ADHD and severe dyslexia and has been medicated for these LDs since 3rd grade. She is currently on strattera and adderall but she still struggles to keep up with the homework load at school and her grades suffer. She also started a high school at a new school this year and has had some difficulty finding where she fits in socially. This is very important to her as I'm sure it is for most teenage girls and it should be said that she only attended her previous school for 7th and 8th grade while most of the other students had been there since 2nd and she never really found her placer there either. While trying to fit in at that school she made two major mistakes, causing rifts within the group of girls she was friends with that she was never able to recover from, these have really stuck with her (if you think it's relevant I will describe those events but in the interest of saving space I'm leaving it out).
Most of the time she is a happy kid but for the past maybe 3 or 4 months all she wants to do is shut herself in her room in the dark and look at her phone or computer. Most of the time she is looking at pictures of mag con boys, I think I got that right, or watching shows, she likes Teen Wolf and Skins etc. My wife and I started to think something was up because she never wanted to come out of there to do something with us or go somewhere or make plans with friends but we figured hey she's a teenage girl and being moody, whatever.
About a month ago one of her friends from her old school called my wife and said that he got a text from my daughter saying she wants to kill herself. It hit us pretty hard as can be expected but mostly because we had no idea she was THAT unhappy. My wife talked with her and she said she feels so all alone in the world and she has nobody to confide in or seek comfort in aside from us. We tried to tell her that these things take time to happen and she will forge new friendships that will last forever, not like her grade school friendships that most of which have fizzled out. We took her to the emergency room as there was not a therapist who could see her immediately and the therapist there said that she is not a constant suicide threat, that she has these major depression events and that is when she feels suicidal. We got her into regular therapy just before Thanksgiving and I'm hoping it will help.
Here is where I need your advice. Ever since then my wife and I don't know how to handle her. In the past when she has done poorly in school she gets in trouble and there is usually some big blow up and things go back to normal. Now she is continuing to fall behind on homework and get bad grades and when my wife tries to talk to her they have a huge fight and she goes to her room and we sit there paranoid that she will try and kill herself. It has crippled us as parents. I know that we have to continue being her parents but we are not sure how. There are so many things I want to say to her that I know are the wrong thing to say. I feel like reading her some stories from the internet of seriously abused kids to show her that her life is pretty sweet, or threatening her that if she takes her life I would have no reason to live and will then take my own but I know those are wrong and I'm not going to say them. The question is what is the right thing to say? How do I get through and help her realize that life is worth living and these feelings will pass, hopefully? What do I do about the schoolwork, I told my wife that we just have to set the suicide aside and be parents and punish her when she gets bad grades but my wife is just so afraid they will have a fight that pushes her over the edge. Thank you for taking the time to read all this, I'll answer any other questions you have if it will help.
