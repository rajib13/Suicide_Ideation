Love my mother, but she is making my depression and anxiety worse. Resentment
Long story short, my mother, as much as I love her, is one of my biggest "triggers". It's getting to be really, really difficult and I'm not doing well mentally or physically.

Some important details:

-I can't move out right now.

-I can't afford my own car. So I constantly feel trapped.

-I'm a recent graduate doing temp jobs while I continue applying for a permanent position in my field. I have tons of debt. I commute with her to and from work in the morning since we work nearby for the time being. She is very bitter, so she rants and complains and goes on and on in the car the whole ride to work and back home.

-She talks over me, doesn't listen, and is somewhat toxic

-I am not allowed to express my feelings of frustration or dissatisfaction Just take my word for this. It will take to long too explain. It's a combination of cultural exception (about 25%) and her being emotionally abusive as a person (75%).

-I have a new therapist since graduating. He is not helpful with this issue, so I'm currently in the process of finding a new one and starting all over again. No, she doesn't know I see a therapist. She would be judgmental.

I feel so trapped and stuck and alone. My head goes to dark places. I am always tired. I feel hopeless. When I'm around her, I feel anxiety symptoms in my body sometimes.

I love her and I feel so bad for the anger I have towards her. I am finding myself to be more and more resentful. And while I think my anger is justified, I know that it is just making me more sick.

What do I do? I feel so sad and so tired
