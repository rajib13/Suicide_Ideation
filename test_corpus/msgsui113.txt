I haven't got to the stage of planning anything or anything of the sort, but I toy with the idea almost every night.
It terrifies me, being so certain that that is how I will meet my demise through my own hands at some point in my life. But how long can one take this? All the strength in me is being drained.
To whom who may read this, I want to say goodbye. I hope you can find some joy in your life. I hope that you get want to want, I hope you achieve your goals.I'm just tired of everything now, same shit everyday. I'm sort of scared because I don't know what to expect. I've only been on this planet 18 years and I haven't had any joy in my life. It's the final straw. I'm gonna jump from a local multi-story car park here in the UK.Congrats to everyone that shit on me in my life, you have won.Bye...No reason to live. Everyone left me and I'm alone like i feared. Just what i deserve. I haven't even got someone to call. Everything is gone. I'm a fuckupi dont know how i ended up on this thread on a sunday night but i did i am just so scared of everything that is going to happen maybe this is just for someone to acknowledge my feelings or something but no one believes me when i say i want to kill myself. eight suicide attempts later and i still cant get it right, its either not waking up for 20 hours, puking right away and blacking out, or getting sent to a psych ward. ive been told each attempt was just me trying to get attention but im scared im gonna die and everyone is going to feel guilty for not realizing how serious i was being. even after how people treated my illness im still worried im going to hurt them? is this normal? my anxiety makes it hard for me to attempt all at once but the depression is really calling me tonight, i need help but i dont really want any? i just wish people would finally know that how i am feeling right now is something i feel and not something i made up. ive got my prescribed meds that would kill me once i took enough and swallowed it down with any choice of alcohol next to me. and i dont know if this is believe me and a cry for help or goodbyeI got into college one of 5 days last week. That means I missed 20 hours of education or so. I have no idea how to catch up on work and I'm too anxious and ashamed to go back. I don't have the energy to do this anymore. I'm thinking of just getting an apprenticeship or something. Or going into work.This probably sounds like a stupid reason to die but to be honest, people expect so much of me education-wise. They'll be heartbroken at my decision. My late nan would also be so disappointed in me, which kills to think about. It's so hard to cope without her- and I can't imagine how my mum will deal with this. She's lost her mother, brother and now potentially daughter in one shitty year.What should I do? Is there anything left for me to do?How will everyone act after I'm gone, will my mother and other family members recover?, will people speak ill of me?, I don't want to be remembered as an attention whore, I just want to go, I don't like where my life is going, I'm scared and I think suicide might be my best option, for me and for everyone
