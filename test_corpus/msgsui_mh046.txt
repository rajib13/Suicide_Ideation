Whenever Im talking to someone and I think I know something they dont I unwillingly smile. I do the same thing if something bad happens to them or if Im forced to admit something positive about myself.

It seemingly makes me the shittiest person in the world to talk to because Im just shooting bad vibes at everyone. I dont think or feel like like the petty person that I outwardly portray.

What is my malfunction and how do i make it go away?
Whats wrong with me? 
It's actually a normal response that some people have and it doesn't make you a bad (or crazy) person! It's thought to be a defence mechanism because smiling/laughter causes a "happy" chemical reaction in the brain. It's seen as inappropriate but it actually makes a lot of sense. It's meant to prepare you for stress and protect you from anxiety.
