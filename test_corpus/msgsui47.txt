I’ve been suicidal for weeks. depressed for as long as I can remember. I’m physically unable to feel happiness. i can't describe the feeling. the closest i get to it is when I’m drunk. i have a great life. everything should be fine, I’m in college and academically succeeding, i have loads of friends who care, my family is together and very nice. but i can't feel any of the benefits of these things. i talked to the doctors weeks ago about it, and ive kept getting worse but they don’t listen. every week i get told the help will come next week and it never comes. two weeks ago i was told i would have to be referred before i could get medication, so i got referred and spoke to the mental health service last week. they told me that i need an appointment with them plus a doctor which would be this week. this week comes and i have an appointment but not with a doctor, just with them again. they have said the appointment with the doctor will be next week, which is only for a slight chance at some meds. counselling is not helping. therapy is not helping. i have not been given medication and i almost certainly will not be even if i survive the ten excruciating days until that appointment. i don't want to go on like this anymore. i don't want to be alive. it hurts so much the more i think and the longer i have to wait. i don't care about the impact my suicide will have on people. i don't care that i have my whole life ahead of me. people keep telling me those things but i don't care. yes I’m being selfish, and no that doesn't bother me. I’m not going to be fixed. so I’m not going to live. tomorrow I’m going to go to the train tracks for my way out. hopefully it can finally be over.
