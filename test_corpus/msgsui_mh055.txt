I know you guys aren't doctors, but what's wrong with me?
I have a therapist I'm starting to go to, but I'm impatient to vent about this. And I fear that I'll forget to say about all of this to them. And I fear that if I write it down, I might end up thinking that these thoughts are just delusional and end up erasing it, so. I have a problem... Why do I constantly fear that I might be wrong about everything, especially my memories? Why do I go from believing that I'll succeed in school and become a famous millionaire, to thinking I'll end up homeless and I'm completely screwed? Believing that I have the potential to have a 160 IQ and that I have the potential to speak 7 languages, to feeling like I might be extremely stupid, delusional, etc? I always tell myself I'll do something or that I'm committing to something, but I NEVER follow through. I mostly feel the grandiosity, but then all of a sudden I sometimes get extremely sad and anxious and feel like I might be completely delusional. What's wrong with me??? 
 when I was depressed and an insomniac, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type 2. However, my family and I doubt that I have this. Because I never had euphoria or mania or hypomania, just an urge to do really stupid things like drinking and popping pills and I don't know why, because I didn't think it'd feel good. It was just random. I also never got euphoria and grandiosity. I just didn't feel as suicidal. I still felt just as pessimistic and terrible and everything, just didn't feel as much sadness and I'd pace around in my room listening to music. It's very hard to explain. Either way, I was always extremely depressed. Maybe I do have Bipolar Type 2 and the depression interfered with the hypomania? Idrk. Anyways, I got on meds for a few months for it, jumped off because of how bad they were for my physical health and they made me have 0 personality. Caused me to be extremely paranoid for about a week. Since then I became a much happier person and all of those problems were gone, but randomly (a long time later, but I don't know when) I started to feel like sometimes I'd feel really low for an hour, and then be normal again. It either happens a few hours after having too much coffee, after the Adderall I got on recently wears off, if I stay up too late too much, or rarely before bed if I've been experiencing a ton of stress. I guess it can happen randomly sometimes too? Idk. Either way, it only lasts for an hour, but I'm starting to experience it more from this Adderall. It's just so shitty because I feel like I might be way too optimistic all the time, but I don't know.
All these things take a lot of time and commitment, it's easy to say "next year i'll be this or that" it's an entirely a different thing to see it through or even work towards seeing it through. Same sort of thing happens (though not as majorly) when people go to loose/gain weight but never do.

That said it is clearly a problem, one i'm not trained for. So as always i urge you to basically say exactly this to someone who's job it is to deal with it. Reddit is a nice place to vent and share but not a particularly good place to really dig deep into your mind/emotions and really root out the problems.
