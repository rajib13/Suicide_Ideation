Being dismissed by professionals
Hello, this is something that has happened a lot and the way they say it makes me always upset. Because at first the excuse was that I did have a diagnosis, but that me knowing it would only make me worse. Now, it's that I'm not "sick enough". And it sounds stupid to me, because I keep telling them I just want someone to explain what's happening to me these past years and why I keep needing psychological help and can't keep my studies in check. And it's always "yes, you have big struggles, yes your mood/thinking/life is affected but not affected enough thus it's not an issue". My therapist has even assumed I'm going through life okay because of it, which made me breakdown. What is affecting life enough? I can't get a job nor keep friendships, I have zero life.

I mean, I know a diagnosis isn't a magic badge you put on and you're cured, neither is that what I want. A diagnosis for me is an answer, because I keep going back to same struggle no matter what I do, so knowing why would help me. I could understand it and know why. After 5 years in therapy and 10+ years struggling, you kinda want to know why! I have my "suspicions" but I don't want to self-diagnose, of course, so I just tell myself one day I'll find the why. But seems never.

Has anyone gone through this, of doctors dismissing over the years about your struggles? And if yes, what helped you?

And before anyone asks: I can't get other therapist now, it's not possible - I have no money, my parents wouldn't pay if they could also, I am only seeing this one because it's from the public system. And I can't get others from public system. I am following a DBT workbook, because the therapy sessions aren't many, but it's too early to say if it's helping me.
Little background: I did get a 'temporary' diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder in psychiatric hospital (over 4 years ago) but even that psychiatrist said I should get reassessed because I went into remission and things could change. After that, the new one not only refused giving a new diagnosis, but ignored any other symptoms I discussed. Pretty mu
well you saw two different ones and it’s worth a shot to call and ask if you really want to have some more info on what’s going on with you. your records should be on paper and filed away, maybe even copied. I definitely suggest you try and see, you have nothing to lose! good luck and I hope you can see a better therapist willing to discuss your mental health more in the future. you deserve that ch any other symptom I mentioned that wasn't hallucinations was "nothing". I stopped seeing that psychiatrist close to 2 years ago. 
The first one only saw me for a month and said "schizophreniform", I know because I have the discharge papers. But that was it, only in psychiatric hospital. So that'd mean I'd have to call the hospital and I'd rather not. Bad memories plus hard to speak in phone with anyone, and my parents feel I am "okay". Also, I never had therapy in hospital nor anything beside the 15 minutes 3x a week on medication, so doubt has much information. I'll think about it, though, thank you. Never know when opportunities come. And yeah, hope so. But hopes are bit small hahaha
