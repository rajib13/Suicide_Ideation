My depression would be a lot better if I would get a better attitude
I had a rough start to today. I got to be at work at 6 30 am. I start off today by waking up and looking over at my clock that says its 6 25. I set my alarm clock to 5 20, but it never went off(it would still be buzzing when I woke up if it went up and I somehow slept through it). So obvious thats not good, waking up 5 mins before you shift starts. First thing I do when I wake up is look to see if I didn't set my alarm, I must of not set it since it didn't wake me up right? Well look over at my alarm, and it was set to the correct time, there was no wrongly adjusted volume, ect. it just failed to go off. So I plop out of bed at 6 25 and throw my uniform on and go out the door. I feel miserable, I didn't get my shower, my hair isn't combed, teeth aren't brushed, no breakfast or time to get food to bring. Instead of being grateful that I woke up at 6 25 naturally instead of 8 25 am, I am livid. I am so pissed off that my alarm didn't go off and acting like the world has it out for me because I had a bad start to the day. Didn't even get in trouble for being late. If I would just stop focusing so much on the bad things I bet my depression would be a lot better if I didn't focus so much on every little bad thing that happens.

This right here is exactly what is so fucking nefarious about mental illness. See what your disease is doing right here? You feel responsible for the effects of your disease but you can't control them. This is akin to being angry at yourself for not being able to run while nursing a broken leg.

Don't blame yourself for not being able to function when your depression is getting the better of you. You will have bad days. That's the just how it works, I'm afraid. But those bad days are not your fault. Never blame yourself for them.
