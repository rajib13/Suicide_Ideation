I feel like I want to kill myself, and I don't know why. Please help.I confessed that I was feeling suicidal maybe 2 months ago, and since, everything's been so cold and awkward. I don't know what to do anymore. It doesn't feel like anybody really cares and I'm feeling like more of a quiet, reclusive burden than a fun friend anyway.Where do I go from here? I don't know how to 'be myself' anymore. The only joy I get is sleeping and fantasising about suicide because then the fantasy sometimes becomes the dream.i hate myself. i hate my life. i hate that i hate my life. i hate my acne. i hate how it wont go away. i hate my body. i hate that I’m skinny. i hate that I’m weak. i hate that i don’t gain weight. i hate how i never exercise. i hate that I’m not motivated. i hate that I’m not motivated to exercise. i hate I’m not motivated. i hate i have no self-esteem. i hate that i try to exercise and i can never keep it up. i hate that people always say "my name is jeff" like its the hot new fucking shit and not a dead overused joke. i hate that I’m single. i hate that I’ve only had one girlfriend. i hate that ever other girl I’ve tried to pursue fucks me over. i hate that i get too attached whenever i think i may have a chance. i hate how i cant tell anyone how i feel. i hate that i cant cry in front or near people so they ask so i don’t have to. i hate that I’m stupid. i hate that ive tried to commit suicide. i hate that I’ve thought about it. i hate that I’m too much of a pussy to go through with it. i hate that i hate myself for not doing it well enough. i hate that i want to. i hate that I’ve even considered it. i hate my life. i hate myself.Don't worry, I won't actually kill myself apparently or I'd have done it already. I just want to share this ridiculous frustration with how I WOULD be perceived after death, isn't that silly? If I'm dead why would it matter to me... but you KNOW there's a difference in how people view the... resulting dead from the tragic accident of being hit by a car crossing the street vs the horror of being murdered vs the struggle of a terminal illness vs the... shame? of killing yourself like damn don’t you wish you could control that one thing
