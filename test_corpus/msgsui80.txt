I just want to die. And before all of those retards show up posting "OMGERD if you really wanted to die, you'd just do it already" let me express the following.I want a relatively painless end. My life has been very, very painful and I don't believe I deserve to be punished by having a painful death.The only methods I can think of that are painless and safe for anyone else that may walk into the place are firearm and shooting up morphine or a synthetic opiate.I don't WANT to die, but I really don't see any other option. The drugs they give me make me feel horrible to the point where I have tried to kill myself by OD several times. I usually end up bashing my head against the wall of a cell until they put me under.I've posted my history on here before. It's rough. But today, beyond all of that damage I'm slogging through, I'm floundering with my anger over my ex's new husband.Given my outbursts before and anger issues, I really don't want to be in the same room as this guy if he says something. I will go bananas on him. I mean, full retard meets American History X. The compulsion has been overwhelming in the past. I have spent these past several years taking the medication and working very hard on my impulse control issues.That being said, I was fine until the dreams started.It seemed like it was all night. This powerful compulsion to beat the living shit out of him. Over and over and over. I would wake up covered in sweat and angry as hell.I started downing my medication by the fistful just to keep myself from going insane and smashing shit around the house.I am proud to say I haven't broken a thing. I've just deleted my facebook, deleted most of my friends off of Steam and braced myself for her (the ex's) anger as she really wants me to spend time with the girls. And I do too.I've been pretty much unconscious since Friday and the urge to go jump off a bridge, in front of a train or to make H2S has been very strong.People on here keep on saying "it's easy to kill yourself, just do it" well no shit retard, but it's much harder to go peacefully and NOT hurt/traumatize people in the process.And I really don't feel like collecting 1 lb of seeds to make a poison either.Does anyone understand what I'm going through? Too broken to be out there, too scared to be in a cage at a psych ward?Because I won't go. Never again. And I will make them kill me before I go back there to all of the bullshit medications, the rolling eyes of the staff and general disinterest in people like me.So instead I've begun a scorched earth policy against my life and everyone in it.I've been torturing myself for years now trying to be ok, but the truth is, I've been too depressed to take care of myself, let alone anyone else and THAT thought right there. That knowledge that I'm too fucked up to be around my girls.... my chest feels like an finger of ice is being pushed into my heart.There's no hope. I'm just too much of a chicken to dig around for a main artery. That and, again, I don't think I deserve such a violent death.Oh and FYI, trying to overdose on street drugs sucks because it isn't pure and I end up just tripping balls and then feeling the withdrawals which is horrendous. Nothing like feeling like a useless piece of shit PLUS feeling like your blood is on fire.
