I haven’t felt right mentally in too long
I just feel broken in all honestly, I feel like I’ve permanently damaged my brain due to abusing drugs when I was young and going through some pretty tough times in the last five years and I just want to be a normal 17 year old kid and live life to the fullest and be genuinely happy and be a normal person.

I’ve not been to a doctor to talk about my issues because it’s the concept of it all is scary as anything and I don’t want my family to find out about it; from self-assessments I feel that I have anxiety, BED and something else that is making me think extremely different and makes me view things in a different light. It’s not scary in any way but it’s very confusing and I want to find out what it is.

If I was to explain this it would be like noticing how people move when they’re talking and really thinking about what they are doing when they do it. Another example could be when watching videos on YouTube I look at the persons face and how they react to different things and almost study and overthink very small things like this, can anyone help me with what this is or what it sounds like?

The point of this is to really look for any general advice as to what I should do for my situation, it’s starting to really take its toll on me.
