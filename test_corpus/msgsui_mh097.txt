Pregnancy and Mental Health
How did pregnancy affect your mental health if you had a pre-existing mental health issue? I'd like to not take medication for major depressive disorder and anxiety, and I'm feeling good now...but did your hormones getting out of whack drastically affect you?
I definitely suggest when dealing with pregnancy and mental illness to discuss these things with a therapist/psychologist along with your doctor as well.

it’s better safe than sorry, and they will be able to help you out the most since they are professionals and have dealt with this before.

they may even have more natural type options to offer you if you’d be interested in that. which just because something is natural, doesn’t mean it’s good for you and your baby. which is why the doctors will be able to help you figure out your options and what is best for you
I ended up with some kinda severe PPD...I’m diagnosed bipolar 2 w/ generalized anxiety. No meds during pregnancy (or ever, really..) and mix all that with tons of dysfunction within the household and with my sons father, and bam. It wasn’t great. If at any point you start feeling symptoms of depression pleeease tell your doctor.
