About a year ago I ruined my life. I went to school shitfaced every single day due to extreme social anxiety and depression. Little did i know, my life would only get 100x worse when i got caught. getting driven to this hospital to get my stomach pumped, getting picked up my dad broke my families heart. They let me go back to school a weak later and i was so happy to see all my friends and return to my passion: violin (it was a performing arts school). although i got past substance abuse, my depression continued to grow, and during winter break my parents found my fiesta which had all my personal information and feelings on it on my mental health and sexuality and it was very embarrassing due to the fact that i wasn’t ready to come out. They made me switch schools to a closer one and promised i could return to my old school after i got better. By April, my mentality improved and my therapist said i was good to go back but my parents didn’t even try. I’m now still stuck in this god awful school in which i cannot truly call anyone my friend. All my friends from my old school have lost contact with me. My parents emotionally abuse me and my sisters every day and they all have an escape with their friends and boyfriends at school but for me life has become one tumultuous torture. I work hard every day to please my parents by practicing violin, working on my grades and losing weight but it is never enough for them. every day i tell myself that once this year is over ill be in college and ill have my own life with new friends and some sort of partner but i cant fucking live this awful cycle one more day. I haven’t been sober to school in over a month, i smoke my wax pen in the bathroom every single day because i cant stand existing anymore. I haven’t told one person in my school about who i truly am or anything and everyone else is in a relationship or at least has a fucking friend. I cant fucking hold this in anymore. school is hell home is hell sleep is hell I’m going to end this awful existence on the anniversary of the day i ruined my life. i keep telling my self it will be better next year, but i also said that last year and now I’m more suicidal than I’ve ever been in my life.
