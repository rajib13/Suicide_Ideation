Top of FormHonestly, I don't know what to say to any of you. Self mutilation makes me feel fucking amazing as it regulates my depressive mood swings well. Not going into my past because I don't care anymore but yep, I love the feeling of a knife against my face or across the chest.I'm 27, highly intelligent and beautiful. My issues are related to past relationships with family and ex girlfriends/boyfriends (male) btw but that doesn't matter either.Life is boring. Everything everyone gets excited over makes me want to jam a knife into my axillary artery and drain out like fucking livestock.It's hilarious. I'm an accomplished guitarist/musician with a huge portfolio (hard jazz fusion/progressive nu metal) and nobody gives a shit. Not saying I need approval to continue doing what I love but it's got to the point where it's not a viable career option anymore. Yeah, audio engineering is versatile and I can make do But I'm starting to realize it'll be lost once I'm gone.The thought of death and the feelings or non-feelings I'll have make me giddy and excited. The loathing and hatred that has consumed my very being is starting to show from beneath the mask I wear.I ask myself this: If others can end it then why can't I?Soon though. Who knows. Also, you can downvote since it's not a direct emergency. I wouldn't care anyways.Bottom of Form
