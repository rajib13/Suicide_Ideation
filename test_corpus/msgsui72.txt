I'm in a midwestern airport and it's 5 am and nothing feels fucking real anymore. Like I don't think I could talk to anyone if they tried to. I'm on my way back to college from break and I live in the PNW and I go to school in the northeast. And it's so fucking hard like I knew I loved the PNW but I didn't realize how much until I had to leave. And like the reason I left was I wanna study set design and there's none of that in the PNW but I just feel so weird and far away and I wish I could immerse myself fully in the experience but I can't. And I have a boyfriend back home and we're doing long distance and it's been working but this week I've been home was really hard. And I just feel really unsatisfied with the whole experience and just. I wish I had more time!!!! But instead I'm here and it feels like there's no way to go home without feeling like a failure. because the whole point was always to get out but then I got out and realized the place for me was the place I'd always been. I just want to live in my city with my boyfriend and make shit. And it feels like it's never going to stop being this hard and there's like this hard pit of emptiness in the middle of my stomach. And I love the work I'm making at college it's an opportunity I couldn't have anywhere else and it's like. Ok so I found the perfect thing for me and I'm still not happyI dunno i guess I'm asking if it ever gets better or if adulthood is just feeling like this because if it is I want out
