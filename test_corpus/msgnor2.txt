Environmental scientists are arguing that the risk of pollution, specifically to the oceans, is too great to ignore and the tiny plastic particles need to be outlawed.
So I have had a rough couple of weeks. I took an overdose of some heart medication and ended up in the ER. They transferred me to the psych emerge after I was stable who then discharged me. I've been coping pretty well since then but last night had a bit of a hard night. I fainted (something that happened when I'm stressed and is related to my PTSD) when I was with my Paramedic friends and of course they felt like they had to look after me. They took care of my physical issues (hypoglycaemia and low BP). One of them spent close to an hour sitting on the floor with me reminding me to breath, that I was safe and what was happening around me. I was super dissociated and freaked out but they managed to talk me through it and decided I was safe enough to go with them instead of the hospital. One of them sat up half the night with me holding my hand and kept me calm and then I slept next to the other so I wasn't alone for a second. This morning one of them drove me to the ferry and waited with me to make sure I would get home safely. These are people that I have only met a few times and don't owe me anything. I have a super hard time accepting help (not an unheard of trait with first responders) and feel so ashamed that they had to help me like that. I don't feel like I deserved that kind of kindness and it's making me feel really depressed and scared. I think tonight is going to be bad.
Does anyone else feel like people kindness makes them feel more isolated? It's a hard place to be.
