Psychosis or another panic disorder symptom?
So I've had very bad anxiety and panic attacks for the past 2 years.

I have muliple panic attacks every day usually lasting between 30-45 mins. Though recently about a month ago I have started experiences States of pure fear and confusion in which I am convinced my reality is nothing more than a hallucination caused from a delerious state or a vivid dream. I start to sweat and shake as I'm convinced everyone I speak to in my life are either not real or are actually doctors and nurses looking after me in a mental hospital. These States of what I'm going to call psychosis (sorry if this is wrong) tend to last between 1-3 hours and my behaviour becomes erratic and potentially dangerous.

I have a doctors appointment in a couple weeks but I feel like I need to make an emergency appointment to be seen sooner as I am very worried.

I feel as if I should ask to be reffered to a mental health specialist but my anxiety stops me from properly articulating myself to the doctor and I fear I won't be able to explain how severe the symptoms are.
