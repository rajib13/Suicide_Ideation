Is this my life then?
I feel so low at times I struggle to see the good side of things. I have my good times but I can't relate to them when I feel down. I'm so lonely but I feel that even if I solved that issue I will just find something else that makes life hard because I am not even grateful for what I have achieved and overcame in the past. I'll always want more I fear I'll never be satisfied with my life. I have lost interest in the things that I loved. I used be an avid gamer and now I'm lucky if I go one hour before it starts to feel like a chore. I don't really watch TV I find very little entertainment with it. I box to stay fit and have a hobby and that's all well and good whilst you're doing it and it does give you a little boost for a while. But I never know how long until I'm low again. I'm to young to be the way I am. I have a poor social life and social skills so I drink a lot because I'd only be staying at home if I wasn't. It feels awful to be 19 and feel like a grumpy lonely old man with some form of social anxiety. 
Definitely do't be loking to TV or gaming to find any form of joy in your life. Look at pursuits that cause you to connect with people. Try something like volunteering, it will give you a new perspective on life and you might meet some new friends. The main thing at this point is to start reaching out to people, rather than retreating inside yourself. At 19, it is super easy to meet new people - it gets really hard when you're older, so make the most of it now. The only way you will learn social skills is through practice - get out there and start some conversations, and power through your awkwardness and your shyness. Just do it, and don't overthink things - it will be hard work but so worth it in the end.
I second this. At your age you should be going out and socializing. I'm 35, and when I was a teen in high school, I spent all of my time in the basement on the computer. I'm not saying computer programming and playing video games is necessarily bad, just that if you don't have friends at that age, and you don't develop social skills, it can get harder when you get older. Once I got to university I was a social misfit. I had terrible relationships (I'm actually surprised these happened at all), and no friends except this one guy who used to help me through everything (emotional problems, not school. ). The high point was when some old friends I knew from high school reconnected with me and I was briefly a very crappy drummer in their band. There's an idea - pick up an instrument and join or start a band. Go to shows. That's always fun. If you're really intent on gaming, find a gaming club. I know some people who were into that and things worked out for them.
What I'm saying when I mentioned TV and gaming is that small pass times do nothing for me and I spend a lot of time alone. Volunteering probably wouldn't work for me I have a stable full time job. The real problem is that I'm strange anyway it's just the way I am and people are uncomfortable with the strange. I try so hard to improve my self I don't always feel it's working. I know that every time something good will happen I will just settle in to it and it will become mundane very fast. And I'll take it for granted. I'll be 20 soon and I will still become worse and worse as all the evidence suggests. I have been doing therapy for a short time and I really want it to work but I know it will just become like everything else. Which is just something I do that slowly loses its effect. I don't want to be alone anymore but the end is not coming anytime soon. 
I didn't mean to paint a bad picture - things are not necessarily destined to get worse just because you're getting older. In fact, when you get older you tend to become a lot more comfortable with yourself and all your quirks, and you care less and less about what people think (and here's a little secret: if people judge you, it reflects badly on them, not on you). So I guess I'm trying to say there is still a LOT to look forward to. You will grow out of your self consciousness over time, but you have to learn the art of self love and self acceptance in order to do so. Be kind to yourself and stop bashing yourself with negative thoughts. Volunteering was just an example. You need to find other hobbies and ways of meeting people. And who cares if you lose interest over time - at least you tried, right? The only losers in life are those who never try in the first place.
