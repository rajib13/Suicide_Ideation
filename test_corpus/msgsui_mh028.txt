common depressed
I had on and off bouts of depression since I was in my teens. I thought I was about over it, but then I moved out for the first time on my own (no family or roommates). It's only been a few days, but I feel a bit sad and I'm not sure why.

I think I socialize a lot at work but I still feel a little lonely. I was initially excited to have my own space, but now I'm feeling down about it and wondering if it was the right decision. Anyone else experience this?
Yes it is very common to feel depressed after making a big change in your life. Take good care of yourself, socialize, get plenty of exercise, eat well. Reach out for help if it lasts a long time or gets worse.I'm pretty sure everyone gets depressed the first time they realize they have to trade small chunks of their life in order to buy paper that we flush down a toliet Fuck yes. I’ve lived in three different states in the past five years. I’ve realized since becoming full-on depressed that I reallyyy hate change. I used to love spontaneity, but my mental state now has me freaking the fuck out if my environment changes to much too soon. It zaps me of energy.

Also, just a side note, I have a very difficult time living alone bc I can’t escape my thoughts that way. It helps me to live with a roommate.
