No need for description really. I've suffered from depression since i was a child. At 17-19 i went thru a bad relationship with a girl who was out of my league an she knew it. She constantly shit on me an treated me like crap.Fast forward 12 years I'm married but separated as if 1 month ago. All of it is due to me not being emotionally there an not showing appreciation to my wife. I end up have anxiety/panic attacks start 4 years ago.All of this piles into me having zero self worth or self esteem. This last month has pushed me into a very dark hole i have been mildly suicidal before in my early 20s. But this time is worse I've actually made a plan purchased needed items an have the area set up but lacking the courage.I can not live without my wife but at the same time i hate holding her back. I've voiced my thoughts of wanting to die an she only says things like "you better not harm yourself at all." Or "I'll never forgive you!" I know i hurt her but when I'm in my depression stage I'm like a zombie in the world i don't notice stuff or signs. I've told her i take all the blame but i want her to talk to me an to try to work this out but she has zero interest in fixing it. II've lasted this last month on shear willpower hoping i could fix it. Few weeks back she tells me shes 100% done. An i honestly blocked it out for a few days then had a massive breakdown. Since then I've just wanted to die everyday to the point that I've wrote my letter an gathered needed materials.I know we are told not to be descriptive but i have to say my plan.My plan is to mix a few sleeping aides in excessive amount wait till i start to get tired then get in place[a tree in my backyard] an send out my letter on social media. Then just wait till i pass out an hang myself.I guess im writing this just to really say it instead of just thinking about it. So there it is. Maybe ill stick around to talk but who knows my emotions have been swinging so yeah...
