unwanted erections. I have OCD and lately the focus has been on a fear of getting an erection at the worst possible moment. I'm not afraid of what they would mean (such as being gay, etc.), I'm only afraid of the physical erection happening at the worst possible moments and the effects the embarrassment would have on my life. Given my job, it could really destroy my career if it happened.
On the flip side, I have a fear of not being able to get erections when actually having sex.
Can someone give me advice on how to deal with this fear? If you actually have gotten unwanted erections, please don't comment. It will just make my fear worse. I only want to hear advice, please, not horror stories.
I feel depressed when i'm alone, but have anxiety when i'm around people
I feel trapped between these two states.

I've always been fine with being quite and introverted in the past, in fact, I preferred it. I enjoyed being alone and having independence, but lately any time i'm alone I start feeling lonely and depressed.

These feelings seem to go when i'm around other people, but at a cost. I feel like I can only socialize and be around others for so long before I start feeling drained and anxious to the point where I become very self-conscious of my behaviour.

It was weird writing this. I've felt this creeping up subconsciously for a while now but never verbalized or even thought about it - I think I was trying to avoid it, hoping it would just go away. Hopefully this resonates with someone whose had a similar experience.
The audiobook and book hope and help for your nerve has help a lot with my anxiety. Please invest some time in looking for these support options. I know this hard, god it’s such a challenge.

Maybe try going to a library. People tend to be quiet and to themselves. Be strong.
Im going to be bold here and say this is common as many people including me relate to what you have posted. I feel uncomfortable around people but I like them I like nothing better than spoken to if feels amazing when I goes well you can reflect and feel accepted. For a short time. Because then you find yourself alone and bored. Whats wrong is your probably someone who was in the middle of extrovert and introvert. When you were younger you could run from it and so isolation was not a problem. Now your older and wiser. You realise that you can't just run away. You are basically an extrovert being blocked by some social issues and low self esteem. 
Luckily I only have a few friends and none of them are mutual friends of each other so when we hang out it’s usually a one on one basis. Way less stressful but at the end of the day it’s still draining for me.
