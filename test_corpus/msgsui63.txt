my mum is an alcoholic, mum means mom in England, and she drinks quite heavily (like most alcoholics, I know) she must be schizophrenic or something as every time she drinks she acts odd, not like a normal drunk person, she does some nasty things and say nasty things. For example last year my family hosted a small family. she drank a lot and when my dad and I where showing our guests the way home as they could not drive she said to my brother things like "I want to fucking die, do you?" then later that night she got herself arrested as she started yelling at my dad, she through a beer bottle so hard at him that when missing my dad it hit the wall leaving a dent with the serial number in it. another time she drank a lot of my brothers rum and when he confronted her she kicked him out the house, I have seen him 2 times since. because of this all my parents decided to move us to another part of the country where our other family lives.I have lost my friends in the south and the school I now attend is shit.a couple of weeks ago I kicked a hockey ball and it ended up hitting this kid called Lucas in the head, it wasn't my fault it happening but now people have decided my hour detention was not a good enough punishment is they bully me (what i should have got at least 2 hours but the teacher understood it was an accident). I have no friends, I have started eating on my own and i very rarely speak to other people at the school. I moved to a few months ago and have been struggling a lot. Today this prick and his friends went into my bag as some kind of a joke and took my stuff, as I was trying to get it back the prick came over and threw me to the ground and said "this is what you get for what you did to Lucas" so I got up in rage and punched him in the cheek so I am now on the back end of even more bullying for that. I know it seems silly but after my mums alcoholic outbursts and this my life seems really difficult to carry on with. I am not saying all of this for attention, i would just like someone who is thinking Cleary’s advice on how to go about not getting bullied and my mum. Thanks
