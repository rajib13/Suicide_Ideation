Girlfriend with depression
My girlfriend of about a year has always had issues with depression and her mental health. She's said that I've helped with that a lot and in many ways I think I have. These issues tend to flair up around stressful times (during our exam periods etc.). This round of exams, it got even worse and she self harmed twice. She still hasn't recovered from it (has been two weeks since the exam period finished). I have been trying to be as supportive as I can while also suggesting that she/we go talk to a professional about it. Over the past month or so it has been taking a heavy toll on myself as I've been trying to deal with my own stress with hers added on. I'm not sure I can continue doing this so I started pushing her a bit more to talk to a professional about it. She has just told me to back off and suggest that I just be there for her rather than pushing her to talk to someone because she doesn't feel like it will help. I don't know what to do anymore. Her dad is the cause of some of these problems, she hasnt told her mum and only 2 other people really know anything about this. Any advice?
I know you care for her and want to help but if she thinks it's fair to dump her emotional baggage on you all the time without seeking other resources this is going to be a very toxic relationship. Try to convince her to get help elsewhere. If she refuses you need to make the best decision for yourself, which may be leaving this relationship.  Thanks for the comments everyone. Whether I agree with what you've said or not, I appreciate the opinions. I talked to her and she says she will accept help from a professional but is not ready just yet. She is making changes for herself and making small steps in the right direction and will reach the point where she can seek professional help given time. I'm not really sure how much I believe this and I'm half expecting things to just repeat again but for now I'm willing to accept that progress is progress. Even if nothing much has happened her mindset seems to have changed and maybe that will make all the difference. I guess I will keep in mind that I always have a way out though if it gets too much for me at any point. 
firstly all respect to you for caring this deeply for her, but secondly this is a bad relationship and I know you won't be able to keep this up (personal experience). If she just puts all her emotional baggage on you, you won't be able to carry it all. She needs to get professional help, you will never be enough and it will only hurt you both. So may I suggest you start voicing how you feel and if you already have you should get more aggressive (not in a bad way) 
NO. Your comment is terrible fucking advice.

If she is self harming that is her coping mechanism to stressors. You need to address the socioenvironmental triggers first and foremost, and not the self-injury in and of itself. Pain is the stress relief. Whether cutting, burning, hair pulling, whatever it may be.

Self-harming is a FAR different phenomena than suicidal ideation.

Calling the cops and risking involuntary detainment under the mental health act (I'm Canadian) is terrible fucking advice. Great way to make the whole situation worse, bud.

Yes, advise them to seek help through local services, but calling the cops for self injury is ridiculous.

...may I ask what you do for a living?

And if you aren't in the mental health field in some capacity, I would advise you to delete your comment right now. And if you are in the mental health field, you are in some serious need of retraining.
