I can't take living anymore. I'm a 16 year old guy in 11th grade without a single real friend, a girlfriend, or a reason to live for myself. People tell me that it's okay to be alone or lonely but it's not. I feel like if I had someone just to cuddle with and talk to I would be so much happier. People tell me that I'm "smart" yet I keep doing stupid things like staying in bed rather than going to school and not doing projects and other work. People tell me that I'm "handsome" yet I've only had one girlfriend who I met in a mental hospital after losing my last (best) friend from having a mental breakdown and saying I was in love with his girlfriend. I was only with her for two months after she left the hospital (she was in there longer for self-harming) and I never even saw or touched her outside of the damn hospital. Everyone else is getting jobs, being with friends, and easily going to school yet I can barely get out of bed. I put so much pressure on myself to do well in school yet my actions are completely inconsistent along with the fact that this year will pretty much determine the rest of my life. Every night if my dreams aren't nightmares they're of me with a girlfriend, someone who actually loves me for who I am and wants hug and cuddle with me. I feel repulsive and stupid. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is because my parents already lost their daughter (my sister) to a heroin overdose and they say that if I died, they would kill themselves because they live for me. They both have had rough lives and I know that it's true. My dad is obviously slowly developing Alzheimer's and his emotional abuse of my mom has gotten worse. My mom is too precious to deserve what he does to her, which is constantly barraging her with insults to further keep her down and pull himself up from his own insecurities. I try to be nice to everyone, I try to talk to girls, I try to smile and pretend to be happy, but nothing ever works. Just typing this is a struggle and my thoughts are all over the place, I really don't want to live, I just want to press a button and poof out of existence. Without affecting anyone. Like as if I never lived at all.
