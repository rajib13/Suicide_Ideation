I am fed up of life, it seems I try at school for my parents who I don't even like. I have a brother who hates me and a mother who is a alcoholic, both of my parents are depressed clinically and I think that I am. 
I haven't felt neutrally happy for almost 3-4 years and I feel so tired. I would kill myself long time ago but my religion is a barrier. I am thinking about death everyday and wish to die by something I don't have control of. It's too much and I can't handle it.Hey guys (and gals)! Welcome to the third addition of my trilogy of my aimless rambling!I just upgraded my plan to give me another gigabyte of data (only $10 more!) so that I can keep posting. Honestly it's the only thing that's keeping me from going down that dark spiral.I'm sure that it's not only me but I feel like being alone with your own thoughts is just the worst. During the day I'm able to suppress my dark thoughts due to stimulus but when it's time for bed that layer of protection from day to day stimulus is gone. My thoughts are predator to the prey that is myself. Vulnerable and alone they begin to seep into my brain, saturating my cortex with the scariest and loneliest truths like a paper towel soaking up bacon fat.Now it's all dirty and I need to throw the paper towel away. Maybe get a new sheet.so i put this on a reply to another post already but i want to get it out there that if any of you are on antidepressants (i.e. fluoxetine, Wellbutrin, Seroquel), taking larger doses than what is prescribed to you can cause a certain numbness of emotion. it’s not the best way to cope with depression & suicide but for me personally i can live with less pain and suffering in everyday life taking twice my dose of antidepressants.so i put this on a reply to another post already but i want to get it out there that if any of you are on antidepressants (ie fluoxetine, welbutrin, seraquil), taking larger doses than what is prescribed to you can cause a certain numbness of emotion. it’s not the best way to cope with depression & suicide but for me personally i can live with less pain and suffering in everyday life taking twice my dose of antidepressants.It does for me. All I want to do is get a gun and kill everyone who has lead me to the point of my death, then turn the gun on myself. That's all I want to do. I just hope I don't get a gun so it doesn't happen.I'm sick of it all... this constant cycle of feeling happy for a short while only to fall back to thinking there's nothing worth living for, of being confused about what to do with my life. Everything that I've lived for up to this point feels so meaningless and distant to me, my parents, friends, a bright future... I just keep catching myself wishing it would all just end. Life is hard, man, and I don't think I want to go through it anymore, but I just can't find the guts to end it... I feel like such a fucking coward, both for thinking of this easy way out, and for not being able to do it. Add in my constant paranoia about those closest to me, thinking about how they secretly hate me, and I can feel my mind slowly going insane from it all.... I can't even cry it out, only bottle it all up and keep it in, it gives me a constant sinking feeling deep inside. I just want it to end, I just want peace and a reason to live
