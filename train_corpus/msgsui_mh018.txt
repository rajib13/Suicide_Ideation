So I had the thought "I am not a person now" BECAUSE of my PT-141 side effects of anhedonia and blank mind. Due to these symptoms I had that thought. Therapist says I need to find the cognitive distortion and change my thinking with this thought. Or to just watch the thought float by and not get carried away with it.
All that FRANKLY IS USELESS--NO AMOUNT of meditating or CBT gets rid of the aforementioned symptoms and hence I will STILL think that thought.
Its the damn symptom causing that thought not the other way around. There is absolutely no reason for me to be thinking that thought except for my symptoms themselves.
So why the hell do therapists focus so much on thoughts when its the symptoms themselves which in my case are making me NONFUNCTIONAL???
I am unable to do things people take for granted--such as school/social interactions/etc.
Therefore due to my feelings and inability to do behaviors I have every right to think this thought.
CBT is so fucking useless when it comes to severe physiological symptoms. Why is it even a prescribed therapy?
