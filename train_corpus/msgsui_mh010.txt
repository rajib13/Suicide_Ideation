Hi all, I haven't done a lot of therapy and am looking for a provider. I have good insurance and there appear to be a large number of covered providers.

My question is should I be pursuing a psychologist specifically? I figure they are the highest qualified. I also see MAs, MEDs, MSWs, etc. I am just not sure what all these designations mean and what might be most effective.

I know I am interested in cognitive behavioral therapy and that I probably need more than an hour a week of treatment. I suffer from depression, anxiety and choice paralysis.

I might even need to pursue some sort of out patient program? I'm not sure what kind of things are between 'therapy once a week' and 'hospitalized'.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
