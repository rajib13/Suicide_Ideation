I'm sick of this
Sick of feeling like a waste... the idea of dying scares me, but I feel like I need to get away. I'm not made to live a life like this.
Hang in there bud. Eventually everything will work out do something to express yourself This is just one blimp in a very long life you have ahead of you and one day without realising you’ll be okay. It’s a long road but nothing as important as this would be anything but. If you have any friends or family you feel comfortable confiding in please do. Or if you just want someone to listen my inbox is open. This has been helping me and maybe it’ll help you too.
