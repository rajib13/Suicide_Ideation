i have no label 
Let me say, that in regards to labels of any kind, I'm not a fan. But when it comes to understanding my mental health, well, i wish i had one.

I have traits of PTSD, BPD, A depressive disorder and something on the autism spectrum. But they're all just traits, only once have i been properly diagnosed with something and that was BPD, but im a lot better when it comes to handling that.

The problem is.. I know there is something wrong with me, i know ot must be all these traits lumped into one but i hate the concept that i cant just say 'oh i have this'. Talking about mental health is important to me on some level, but its a lot harder to talk about it when you don't really know what's wrong..

I see my psychologist tomorrow, so I'll talk about it more with her, she understands my struggle. But what if there is no diagnosis out there.. It is too hard for me to accept so many things and this one seems to be the biggest.
not here to diagnosis you, but if you had long term trauma, you might be looking for the term CPTSD. it's not an official diagnosis in the DSM but it is to the ISD[?]. You could bring it up to your therapist.

CPTSD is PTSD with symptoms of depression, BPD, DPDR, and sometimes symptoms that overlap with other personality disorders, anxiety disorders, autism, or attachment disorders.
 If you don't meet the criteria for BPD/depression/etc, but you have trauma, then CPTSD is the best label. Trauma has a lot of varied effects on different people, so it's not so simple to diagnose. I hope the psychologist can help you.
Today, the DSM manual I think lists over 400. They are still all based on the original two but its much more complicated now because we seem to add more and more every year. Its often hard to pin down just what anybody has now.
