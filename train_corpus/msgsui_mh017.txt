Somethng metaphysical and esoteric human condition of tough guys and wussies
This is going to intrigue me for the rest of my life. I used to (and hopefully am still to a degree since I really liked who I was ) a bit of wuss. I was emotional, sensitive, and had a hard time getting over relationships. Probably had a low self-esteem too, thought other people were better than me, was a bit codependent, a bit narcissistic, needed approval. I was nice. I certainly hope I wasn't a nice guy(tm), but I was nice. If you want to look at it in terms of biology, I think I had a very reactive nervous system. Small things in the environment would throw me off baseline. The nice thing is, I had an "artisan" temperament. Music really moved me emotionally. I remember I used to have candles set up at home. I had a nice rug, and lamps, loved the outdoors. I was very sensitive to the environment. Of course, this caused problems. As I said, breakups were really hard.

So something happened...I won't get into the details, but someone convinced me to act tough for a while. To say "screw it" to everything, whereas everything used to concern me (my psychiatrist thought this was OCD) but it might've been something psychological, something that had something to do with being a wuss.

Anyway, for the past while, I've been acting tough, pushing people away, putting myself first, and crushing my emotions. Like a machine, the tough guy. I can understand the advantage of thinking this way. I used to blame myself for things or worry that I had done something wrong when I hadn't. I can see how that might've been a problem and how it might relate to the break-ups.

The problem is, I'm' afraid I'm going to be stoic, dispassionate, and like a machine (like the terminator from the movies) for the rest of my life.
