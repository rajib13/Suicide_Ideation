Childhood grief stunted my emotional growth
That's my primary concern. I also started drinking at a young age, which I'm aware could have helped to my stunt emotional growth.

I'm a 23-year-old female. Lesbian. My mom died when I was 9. My dad and stepmom are alcoholics/addicts. I've been dealing with a lot their addiction and my codependency and possible addictions in therapy. I'm still grieving it. I realize that's also common...

So many of my relatives, friends' parents, friends and colleagues compliment me on how exceptional I am and how much I've succeeded. Especially, considering...

I graduated from college, have a full time job in a non-profit clinic. I'm giving back with a "fulfilling" job. It mostly is fulfilling. I just doubt myself so much.

I feel like I can't deal with criticism in the professional or personal sense. I do drink a bit too much to deal with anxiety, grief... I feel like I can't cope and be an adult without it. I am afraid I have ruined my chances of taking care of myself as a normal adult because of that, on top of losing stable parents along the way.

Does anyone have experience with this? Adult children who have lost parents as kids; abandoned at an early age (even if only in the emotional sense, too); orphans; addicts/alcoholics. I feel so lost in the world right now, trying to manage as an adult.
