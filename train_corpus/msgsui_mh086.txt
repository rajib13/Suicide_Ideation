I don't know what to do with my life.
I'm quite normal teenager. In my life there were good and bad moments. But now I have no idea how to live my life.

It may be partly because of my annual autumn-winter depression, but my life is not giving me much sense anymore. My grades went down, I have problem to keep up with all homework we get in school.

I don't get why I feel how I feel. My personal life is finally getting better. I don't date girls who just used me just for ventilation of their problems. I have friends. I have even found sporting community that I can be real part of.

However fear of failure in school and my strong love for my close friend (which will never be fulfilled, because he (trans-boy) is interested in girls) are frightening me and are sucking happiness out of my life. 
unrequited love is painful, definitely, but sooner or later you have to let that go. if you truly cherish your friend and respect him as a person, then just be happy for him and let go. easier said than done, but if your friendship matters to you then it’s not really worth losing it over a crush. u can love them in other ways, and not romantically, and he would probably still feel your warmth.

for school, see where youre not falling in line with and work on it. see your tutors and ask for help. you have to find a method in studying/concentrating in class that works for you. there’s no point in people telling you what to do and what works best for them if you are unsure where your difficulties lie. i have concentration problems and i cant listen for more than 20 minutes in lectures. so i go to class, listen attentively for 20mins, do something else like use my phone for maybe 10mins, listen to the lecture for 20 mins again. you need to know yourself in order to fix yourself.
