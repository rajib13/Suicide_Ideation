Employment options and mental illness 
It’s only jobs in careers like the military and the police force that actively disqualify you from applying, because of the psychological demands of the job. Possibly there are similar requirements for people working in emergency services/emergency medicine? Other than that, there are probably jobs that might not be suitable (high stress can bring on episodes) but the employer can not discriminate against you unless your mental illness will affect your job performance.
Recently diagnosed with some mental illnesses including psychotic disorders. As a person starting to look into the job market, I was curious if anyone here knows any fields that do not accept people with mental illnesses, particularly psychotic disorders. Basic googling had only given me results on the military and some law enforcement. Sorry if this isn’t the appropriate sub, not sure where else to post. Thanks :)
There is a really big difference in how functional people are within disorders. I guess in most jobs they care about if you are functional enough or not and how often you are not functional. Some people dont tell their employer of their mental illness and get away with that fine. It depends on your situation.

treatment teams and municipalities usually have support if you need to figure out your employment situation and if your situation or plans need changes now that you have a diagnosis.
