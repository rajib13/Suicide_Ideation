I'm at war with my head and my heart and everything around me 
I'm currently fighting with myself right now. I'm at war with my feelings because I'm just depressed and scared and feel so alone and the only person I want to talk to or have hold me is my ex but he cheated on me with one of my friends and I thought I was over him and it but apparently not. Ever since the girl and her friends have spread rumours I'm going to fight her now it's all coming back and I just want it to stop. I want to call him and hear his voice and have him tell me it'll be ok but I know if I do it'll only make it worse for him and probably me but I just can't deal with this..
how does the depressed help the “depressee”? please please please help
i’ve been diagnosed with a laundry list of mental health issues, all that i’m working to better, whether that be with prescriptions or with therapists/social workers. i’ve got a surly good handle on my issues but my boyfriend has been exhibiting signs of depression recently, and i don’t know how to help him.

he tells me that he’s in a “funk”, that he’s stressed out and his mind is constantly racing and it’s loud.

i’ve tried to get him to talk about what’s bothering him but he can’t seem to place it, i’ve done grand gestures to try to perk his mood, i do all the things that i know he likes (physical contact, playing with his hair, singing to him) but nothing seems to work.

short of suggesting he maybe see his own therapist, i was wondering if any of you have any suggestions to help me help him.
