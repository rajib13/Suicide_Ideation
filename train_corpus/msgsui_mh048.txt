How do I help my depressed friend?
My friend has been depressed for many many years now. We just recently got close and the past few months she has opened up about her severe depression and I try to talk to her, just help in whatever way. I myself have gone through depression for a few years, I managed to beat it. I know everyone is different but I tried telling her the things that helped me and it doesn't seem to work. The issue is she makes no effort to change. She doesn't want to seek help and isn't willing to open up to her family about it. According to her she's tried everything and nothing has worked. She keeps talking about wanting to kill herself, she has tried before. I can't be there physically with her, we live far away from each other. Even when she has days that are good she'll be at home crying at night and it just feels like this is happening every night. I have tried talking to her boyfriend about it, he has no idea what to do either. I literally have no clue on how to help her. I am very worried about my friend. What do I do?
Is your friend on any kind of antipsychotic at all? If she claims she has tried everything, the last resort is checking herself into the hospital for an inpatient stay in a mental health unit. They almost force you to get the help you need. It was the best thing Iâ€™ve ever done.

Also, I found this website that has a pretty cool list of texts to send to a friend with depression.

I hope this helps. I live with my boyfriend and our mutual best friend and all of us have major depression. So I completely understand your struggle of wanting to help but feeling hopeless. Best of luck to you my friend.
Problems, weaknesses and utilization of strengths. When to do what?
I had this discussion with my therapist this week but only briefly and with no satisfying answers. I'd like to bounce it around a bit before my next appointment.

Basically I realized that I am somewhat unable to tell when one of my traits is a "disorder" that needs to be fixed, a weakness that needs to be developed or a strength that needs to be played to in order to have more success. Specifically, telling when a trait is something I just should stray away from, or a trait that I ought to develop and work on.

Naturally speaking, it's common to say things like "play to your strengths" and "downplay your weaknesses". This suggests that I ought to be okay with my weaknesses rather than try to improve on them. I won't ever be a master at math AND music AND management AND philosophy, and that's okay. I can focus on the strongest and downplay the weakest... Right?

My confusion comes from differentiating between these weaknesses, which can be downplayed, and... Another kind of weak point - a deficiency of sorts - that my therapist says can't be down played. She argues there are some skills that I have to develop, where's I've been treating them as weaknesses and trying to downplay them.

One example is teamwork. I don't really like working with people, I don't like managing people, I don't like the logistics of coordinating people... I'm not that good at it, I absolutely despise it and I'll work alone whenever possible unless there isn't much coordination necessary. If I have to unpack a pile of boxes, yeah I'll happily accept help. If I have to coordinate with a team on something intricate though - say, writing a script or writing software - I find that an absolute pain in the ass and tend to steer away from careers that focus on that kind of work. My therapist says I should not avoid, but work on, those skills. I have no desire to.

I'm trying to make sense of where that line is between what is characteristic of me - what I should be looking for in a career -, what is something I ought to be avoiding In a career, and what is a skill I should develop instead of avoid. Exploring this idea has been insightful but incredibly challenging.
