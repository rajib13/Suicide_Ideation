If feel empty but also overwhelmed with emotions 
Hi. I don’t know if I’m depressed or what i am but i am down all the time. Nothing excites me anymore. Some months ago i got out of this feeling after being in it for over a year. And i had been feeling like that even before for around half a year. But I’m now feeling like that again. It came kinda slowly but it’s now here 100p. The way I’m feeling is empty. I’m not exactly sad but at the same time i am. I don’t know how to explain it. I just don’t want to do anything. Life isn’t something i enjoy.

I don’t know how it’s possible but at the same time as i feel empty i feel like I’m overwhelmed with emotions. I could have a meltdown at any given moment of my day. Especially in school. I’m always whining and annoyed at everything. I overthink every single thing i have to do at school. For the past few weeks we’ve had a lot of tests in school and i always fear them so much. I’m pretty good in school so i shouldn’t really have anything to worry about but i do anyways. I’m legit about to cry every single time we have a test and it sucks. My entire body shakes and my stomach hurts and i feel like I’m about to faint.

But back to feeling empty. I can’t see the importance in life. Like i don’t want to live, bc pretty much nothing makes me happy or excites me. I don’t want to kill myself or anything. I just want to disappear and come back when i feel okay again.

If you have any advice or anything please share it. It would mean a lot to me. Thanks for taking your time to read this. I appreciate it a lot. I just needed to get it out in some way.
