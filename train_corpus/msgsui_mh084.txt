Social media and mental health 
Hi there üëãüèª I‚Äôm new here on this sub but I wanted to share a story and what I‚Äôve done today to see if anyone has gone through something similar. 2 years back, I had surgery and then got blood clots. I was severely depressed, lots friends, became negative, posting on social media turned into not being positive but a place where I harbored a lot of negative feelings for old friends who pushed me aside.

I wanted to deactivate my Facebook but I‚Äôve had it since about 2004/2005 when it was opened to more universities. My relationship with my spouse is on there, entire life of my child, lots of positive memories. So, I decided to do something different.

I played roller derby and would add anyone who was wearing a helmet in their picture. I was up to about 1600 friends. However, I took the time to remove a lot and now I‚Äôm at 540 Facebook friends.

Unfortunately, I do have some anxiety about being talked about, bu whatever. I feel like there is a weight off my shoulders but perhaps I can move towards positive mental health and I can work on writing a book!

TLDR: I unfriended over 1000 people on Facebook today. Have you done something similar and how did you feel?
I've made a habit of checking facebook once a week max, and hiding feeds from friends who are just "brand building". Don't miss it or feel out of touch, and doing much better things with the time. My sister's therapist says if you have anxiety or depression, avoid social media entirely or limit it just to family and very close friends.

She is also wants people to put a limit on constant news watching. All this aggravates anxiety and depression even more.
