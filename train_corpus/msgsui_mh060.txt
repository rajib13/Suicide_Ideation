I have my first CBT session today
I can't help but feel a little skeptical though. I've had talking therapy before at uni for a few weeks and I don't think it helped that much.

I have telephone appointments for CBT and I honestly don't see how it's gonna help either. Guess I'm pretty desperate now though for things to change. But a lot of the time I feel like I'm just getting told things I already know? I've had anxiety problems for 7 years now, so I know the whole how it works, I just wish it would stop!

Hopefully someone here can give me hope with a positive experience you've had with CBT?
Came across a little like you think I've been doing nothing to resolve this. I've threw myself into self-help books and exposure therapy, pretty much everything. I dunno your experiences but doctors I've seen more or less just put you on meds and leave you to it. They tell you the same thing all the time and how anxiety works and how it's just an emotion. There's no extra help involved.

And yes I think it's worth doing, hence why I'm doing it. I was just asking for positive experiences people have had, not to be criticised instead...
You've had anxiety problems for 7 years and a few sessions of talking therapy. I'm not sure what you expected. Talking therapy, CBT, any of them - they're all processes that take time. Put it this way: if your CBT can make even one area of your life even a tiny bit better, then it's worth doing surely?
The only advice i can give is to stick with it. No matter how you feel of if you feel you dont need or want it anymore stay with it. I stopped after awhile for reasons and ended up going back, it does help and takes time.
