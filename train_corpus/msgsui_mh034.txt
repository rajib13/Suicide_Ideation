Hi, I hope this is the correct place to ask this! I am in the USA, if that helps.

I have been seeing my current doctor for a little less than a year (I think). I gradually switched to her because she was in the same clinic as my first doctor.

She has been fantastic so far. She was the first doctor I spoke to about my depression. She even scheduled that appointment at the end of her shift so that she could spend a bit more time with me. I feel comfortable talking with her and I feel like she respects my decisions. If it were simply a matter of the doctor, I would stay with her without question.

Unfortunately, it is becoming rather expensive. I have super cheap insurance, so it covers nothing. I’ve been sick a couple of times this year with multiple office visits each time, plus the check-ups on finding an antidepressant that works. Add in insurance and therapy bills, and it’s getting to be a lot.

As much as I like her, I was wondering if I should switch doctors. I have the opportunity to check out some direct care doctors. The monthly fee they charge would be half of what I’ve paid so far this year, and I wouldn’t have to worry about racking up another $110+ every time I step into the office. I would also get to spend more time with the doctor and less time in the waiting room.

The idea of talking to new doctors makes me nervous. I don’t know how easy it would be to find another doctor that I am this comfortable with.

I also feel really guilty about the idea of changing doctors. Like I said, my current doctor is great, and she has gone out of her way to be helpful. Unfortunately the clinic she works in isn’t as great as she is, and the costs are feeling rather high.

I’m going to talk to my therapist about this tomorrow, but she was recommended by my doctor and has a very good relationship with her. So, I was hoping to get a few outside points of view! Thanks for reading!
