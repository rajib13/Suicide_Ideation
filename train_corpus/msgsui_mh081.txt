Mother is mentally ill and I may have to evict her. Is there no other option?
You can see more about my situation in my post history, but in short: my mother is hoarding 10 dogs and hoarding in general against my wishes in my house. I'm the sole owner but she is convinced she also has some kind of ownership. She's essentially a 68 year old teenager doing whatever she pleases and disobeys even me asking to keep the dogs out of certain rooms. She doesn't pay rent, there's no lease agreement.

I've tried calling the emergency mental health unit, they did a visitation and concluded they could see there was an issue but there was no grounds to take her to the hospital. She wouldn't let them go into her apartment to inspect the living conditions.

Bottom line is, she's clearly mentally ill and totally delusional. Her brother is enabling her behavior by allowing her to use his vehicle and giving her money for dog food. I've exhausted all options with social services and any other public service. The only option is to go forward with eviction. It makes me feel awful but there's no way I can allow this to continue.

Does anyone have any last minute advice?
