A confusing predicament
Recently I've noticed my overall mood going downhill, and I get agitated by every little thing that happens. I feel unmotivated to do anything, but what confuses me is that I have no reason to be feeling down, or sad. Many aspects of my life are already well off, and I have it better than a lot of people. I have no significant health, financial, education, or family issues to worry about. What gives?

Note: I highly doubt this as depression, but if it is, then it would confuse me even more as to WHY.
You might be dealing with mild seasonal depression. As days get colder, shorter, and darker, many people experience a general decrease of mood. It might get better as your body adjusts to the cold, but since it's not even officially winter yet, your systems are still a bit out of whack. 
I find it difficult to deal with because it kind of just stacks on top of my normal depression. But making sure it's bright in the house helps, and little things like enjoying time outside when you can helps too. I'm going to try to focus on the positives of winter this year, like thinking about how pretty snow is and how charming a warming fire is, etc. That might seem silly but hey, brains are weird.
