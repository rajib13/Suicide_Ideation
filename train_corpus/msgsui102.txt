Saw an LGBT post about Disney and commented an unfavourable opinion about how Disney is for kids and after Many down votes and mean trolls the mod banned me for no reason, I contacted them saying what happened to tolerance and acceptance and he pretty much told me to fuck off and I'm worthless and muted me so I can't even respond. It's really triggering me and I'm having a hard time being banned from a community I always felt a part of. I've been on suicide watch the past couple days and things have been really tough now internet bullying is pushing me to extremes.I'm done with life, I can't deal with shit anymore, anxiety and OCD are far too severe to be dealt with without going to a psychiatric ward, and my parents are only going to make my life worse.I know I said it a few nights ago, but I was really hopeful. I am determined. I will not let anything stop me.I'm 14. I have a chronic illness which makes me unable to focus, stand for long periods of time, or do anything I enjoy. It makes my joints loose, and my body is in 24/7 pain, which is much worse when I walk or move.I have no desire to live like this. I need to play sports or be active or something. Cutting doesn't provide the same adrenaline feeling as physical activity, no matter how much I do it. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I don't want to continue living this way.I can't focus and I end up screwing up due to it. I'm a socially awkward fuck. Nobody is really friends with me. I feel worthless. I never get invited to anything. This is hell. I'm going to end it.If I know then Iâ€™m going to die soon, should I just kill myself and save me the misery?I feel so down, lonely, unwanted, and just not worth it. I just want to be annoyed of how many people are messaging me so I don't feel this way. I'm sorry to be selfish. I just hate me and how I feel. I just want to be distracted.
