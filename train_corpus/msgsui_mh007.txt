But I want to die. I feel so abandoned. I must be an idiot. I
hope for some random event to kill me so that nobody has to be
guilty. My loved ones would mourn me but they would move
on. At least easier than if I actively killed myself.
There are times when my brain seems to shut off and I calm
down. But then I panic... about anything. I think I have anx-
iety. I feel like nothing is mine. I don’t, I genuinely don’t,
remember a time where I felt normal.
Theres a terrible feeling through my whole body every waking
moment I have and theres only 2 ways to ending it. It hasnt
been getting better only worse, I am freaking out. The only
thing stopping me is I dont know about/have access to anything
that would make it quick and clean
