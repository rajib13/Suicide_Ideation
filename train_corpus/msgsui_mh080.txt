Very bad neighbourhood in my head
Sometimes it is so hard to be victimized by thoughts. And I just dont know what got me here, it started all of the sudden in the beginning of August. I was afraid of suicide. It felt like I was destined to do it although I was happy with living. Then I got a feeling of being "trapped" in time and that I dont want to get better and that in the end it will be inevitable. Those thoughts of time, that destiny thought, create such strong feelings of dread and hopelessness. I dont even know how to get out of it although I went out again and partying but the thoughts occure spontaneously leaving me feeling like I really am suicidal. Now just the tiniest thought of 2017 being over triggers hopelessness. In the beginning of August I suddenly got like very anxious of time and now I cant even imagine living next year when there is "2018" on the calendar. How will I ever be able to cope with this time thing, just this thought makes me feel so hopeless. It is so strange and I am so alone with it :((

Btw.: I am 19 and diagnosed with OCD and adjustment disorder.
