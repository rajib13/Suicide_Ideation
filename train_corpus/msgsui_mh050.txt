After an intentional overdose a few weeks ago I have had a few home visits from a CAMHS Crisis team and I'm now waiting to see a counsellor/therapist (apparently early to mid december.) while I understand that that's probably a good thing and I do need the help however my main concern is that I'm going to end up doing what I did with the crisis team and default to "Yep I'm fine, no problems here" while in reality it's the opposite and the only time I managed to tell something resembling how I felt was immediately after the OD. Any advice is appreciated and i don't mind answering questions if you need to.
Worries about seeing a therapist
Being aware of the possibility that you will resort to default answers is the first step to countering it. Prepare what you'd like to discuss with your therapist and give yourself the permission and strength to share that. Therapists can typically tell when you're avoiding the real answers and will work with you to find them. Go in with an open mind and good things can happen. Good luck!
