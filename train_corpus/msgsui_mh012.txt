I feel sad all the time. My life is a mess. Do I want to die?
Often, I fantasize about being dead. Just shot in a freak accident. Why don't I kill myself? Is it normal?
I'm somewhat in a similar situation. I feel ok now, even good but there comes a time when i hit a wall and i feel like there's no way around it to continue this journey. Then i think of me being dead, at one point i even searched how to kill yourself. One of the things that is keeping me from doing it are people who care about me, i don't want to make rest of their lives shit. I know i just need to struggle and keep fighting, doing things my way and what i want. With time i'll hopefully feel something similar to happiness and i won't need to run away in a deep hole. I had this exact same problem.
I found out electrical devices (ele. outputs, computers, cellphones, wifi...) were causing it. These emit an electrical field which messes with our orgone energy flow (aka. chi, prana, ki, life force...). I realized my cellphone was causing my mental symptoms and I actually would drive to the mountain every night to fall asleep with no problem but as soon as I got home, my symptoms would return. I then realized my computer was right next to my bed, and an electrical outlet was 1' away from my head, and these were the source of the problem. Once I moved my bed away from these, I was able to sleep in my bed again, stopped having nightmares, I stopped having sugar(carb) cravings, stopped getting headaches, and stopped hearing voices!
