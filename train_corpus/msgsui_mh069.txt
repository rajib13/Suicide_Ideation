I can't stop shaking
It's not involuntary tremors, I just feel incredibly anxious if someone forces me to stop shaking. I shake my legs, and when it gets bad, my arms too. I'll be in bed beside my partner who is trying to sleep, and I just can't stop shaking. I can stop for like 5 seconds but then I start to feel like my skin is on fire. Cutting the shit out of myself (arms, legs and chest) helps for like, that night. I have a lot of mental health issues (clinical depression, constant suicidal thoughts, probably borderline personality disorder comorbid with bipolar disorder) and I don't need to be constantly vibrating in public, drawing attention to myself. How do I stop fidget-shaking constantly.
