Dont know what it might be
I feel on the edge constantly.Sudden bursts Of energy and an impulse to do weird things Like climbing trees in my campus, jumping on schooldesks and kicking stuff have become an everyday thing.My Dreams are very vivid and in A totally random moment of the Day i swear i see everything crystal clear,i feel one with the nature and fast and powerful Like the wind.I think Of everything as A sign sometimes or as if everything has meaning and then i know for A fact that nothing i do or know matters and my actions reflect these.I can be the life Of The social event if i feel that energy burst but i often feel Like im trapped and miserable with most People.I feel indestructable,smart and awesome for A minute and hollow,dumb and intolerable the next.I feel very irritable for A minute and caring and sociable the next.I think Of doing A lot of things but its like my mind never settles on one hobby,even for A minute.I talk excessive and fast and then stop altogether.my mind races and i want to say every thought out loud.The tiniest most insignificent thing can drive me to tears and i find myself hysterical.Like scream crying hysterical. I shift so much moods in A Day its crazy.Sometimes the most lighthearted criticism makes me feel hopeless.i dont know whats wrong and i am desperate for answers P.s.:I wrote these down in A haze so please dont mind the grammatical errors.
Maybe it's Borderline? It goes away after a couple of years usually, but get to a doctor or psychologist
