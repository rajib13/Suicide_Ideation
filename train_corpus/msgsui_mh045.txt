Lonely, miserable, and feeling terrible [M15]
I'm absolutely miserable. I loathe myself constantly, and I've seen things people my age really just shouldn't see. I've went too far down the rabbithole and now there's no way back. Every day, I go deeper and deeper. I'm constantly isolated from the rest of society (internet is only outlet, I rarely go outside or speak to actual people anymore other than my family). You see, I have online school. When I exited 6th grade, I was tired of the fucking degenerates giving me shit for existing, so I was naturally excited for home school. I think the summer after 6th grade was the last time in my life I was truly happy. When I started, it was fine. But it got worse. I fell behind in my courses to the point where I had to file for extensions. This pattern has repeated every time I start a new grade. This means I'm staying up longer, which has destroyed the once stable sleep schedule I had, and I barely get any good sleep or very little sleep at all. My mental state is chipping away. Online school was a devil in disguise. I thought it would be the force that would make me happy again. I couldn't have been more wrong. I've been socially isolated for years on end now. I occasionally go to the grocery store with family members, but that's it. I'm trapped. Every time I bring this up to my mom, she tells me "there's youth groups in this area, just go to one of them", but every time I actually express interest in doing that she says "do your homework first". You really expect me to get fucking straight A's in a condition and place like this? Not to mention by going to online school I abandoned the only fucking ones who cared, my best friends. I've barely heard anything from them. I can't come out to my family members, because they'll just ridicule me and think I'm overreacting. My mind is constantly telling myself I'm worthless. I would say I am. I'm unintelligent, ugly, and generally hate people in general at this point. There are some people I remember from the past which I actively despise, and just thinking about them makes me angry. I honestly want to kill them, they're fucking worthless just like me. They don't deserve to live and are barely worth the air they breathe. I need my revenge. I'm not going to go Postal though. I just think about doing those things.

That's where I wen't astray, I guess.

Years of constant violent thoughts and holding grudges has cast such a dark cloud over my mentality I can't even navigate my life clearly anymore. I'm lost. I fear its permanent, because this has been happening day in and day out for several years now. However, I can still act like I'm happy. And I do. But I don't want to. I want to let it out so much but I just can't, my mind won't let me. Its like I'm being held hostage by my own consciousness. I'm either just empty, angry, hateful most of the time. I constantly think about what would happen if I get through this, but every time I snap back into reality I'm overcome with hatred. I can distract myself (steam, music, netflix), but those are only temporary.

I don't know what to do. I'm not depressed (at least I don't think), suicidal or anything, I'm just lost and I don't know where to go. Even now, as I edit this, I feel like an attention seeking fuckface.

I'm typing this to at least get some of the weight off my chest.

I feel the same way. I used to have friends but everytime they went somewhere they would not only not invite me but insisted that I not go so I decided to try to not get away from them. Although it's nearly impossible because they are the only people i can get social interaction with, but I completely despise them. I too think they are assholes and I want revenge. I don't want to kill them, just ruin their lives.
