 Hi, Reddit! First-time poster, recent lurker; I hope I'm doing this right. Today I had my first therapy session for various issues I'm experiencing at the moment, but it went horrible. Within five minutes, I was crying because I was so nervous. Shaking, avoiding eye contact - the whole nine yards. I felt myself holding back when talking to the therapist and being dishonest because I was nervous and scared and uncomfortable opening up to a stranger. Now I feel like I blew my shot to feel better and I feel almost too embarrassed to go back. 

 Has anyone experienced anything like this? Would you recommend to continue? What have you done to calm nerves and go into a session more organized and collected about what you want to work on? 

 If anyone had some advice or personal experience with this to share, it would be greatly appreciated. 
don't worry about it. For one thing, it's completely normal to feel anxious going into a therapy session. Especially if you are new to it! Talking to a therapist is an extremely intimate activity and it takes time getting used to it. I know I used to be super anxious going into therapy sessions. Also, it's their job to be understanding. They won't think any less of you. it's okay to feel nervous seeing a therapist.

Something that might help your next session is to know what you want to say to them. When I'm nervous about talking to someone, sometimes I imagine the conversation so extensively that I have to write down everything; it's easier to organise your thoughts when you can see them on a piece of paper. The outcome and the process itself are both rewarding. Maybe try that out before your next session?

Best of luck for the therapy treatments, sweetie. Don't give up, you can do this! You got this! :) Go out there and conquer yourself.
