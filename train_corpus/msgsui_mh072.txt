What does depression look like?
I’ve moved to a new place 2 years ago. It’s a different culture, and I’m trying to get used to it. Lately, I feel like I cannot cope with the changes. It’s a beautiful place where I’m currently living at. But I just can’t seem to be happy about anything. I tried shopping, and thought retail therapy could fix it. Maybe it’s because of the fact that I don’t have many friends here. Well, the friends that I have back in my hometown are my soulmates. But I keep telling myself it’s fine, and that I have friends back home. It just ain’t cutting it though. I keep shutting out people, because I feel like I can’t be myself with them.
