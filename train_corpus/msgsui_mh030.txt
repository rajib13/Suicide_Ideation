You reached for advice because you seem to have problems with clear and logical thinking. So here is a very simple advice. You have a problem but you are unable to solve it -> A person/a psychiatrist who specializes in solving these problems offered you a solution, but you refused to take it and continue to try solve it by yourself, when clearly you are unable to -> Simple answer: try the solution/medicine first. That medicine is needed to reduce the chaos in your life, to have your mind under control. You think that this alignment is the problem. It's not. It's an imaginary problem created by your mind and it doesn't need solving. It needs to be erased altogether if you want to ever live and enjoy life. And if you're really thinking about killing someone other than yourself, you are a danger to society. It is selfish to think you can take another person's life. If you wan't to actually do something major, something very important - get healthy mentally. This will make a huge impact on your and everyone elses life around you
Hey man I can't really relate to whatever is going on with you but just as someone with an outsider perspective, I think it is important to remember that everyone around you even if they are in some "present" that you can't align yourself with, they can still help.

I think you maybe posted this because you believe this fact. You just want someone to validate the pain maybe idk. But I think if you saw a psychiatrist and they prescribed you some med I would advise taking them. Even if they don't work I feel like the negatives from the meds wont do very much harm. Worst case you just stop taking them and tell the doctor they don't work. But at least try.

You probably expected to hear this one, but I believe resorting to violence is never a good option. It's okay to think thoughts, we can't always control what our brain does, but with all the effort you save with not controlling your thoughts, use it to control your actions as much as possible in order to keep yourself and all the people around you safe. Which means no violence.

Like I said before I cant relate very much but what I can relate to is hopelessness. All I can say is to just embrace the pain. Cry, sob, fall over, faint, do whatever you need to FEEL the pain so long as you don't hurt yourself or others physically. The struggles are hard, but just like you want to get better, I want you to feel better. Hey friend, I hope you're doing a bit better since you shared this with us. Thanks for doing that by the way, it takes a lot to open up like this on a public forum. To your plea that you 'dont know why you posted this', I think you did simply because you need help. Before I continue I need to reiterate that I am absolutely not a professional and it's important to force yourself to do as the doctor/psychologist is saying because they are providing an objective solution to your problem. Drugs won't solve the issue, it will help you get into the right mindset in order to better yourself. See them as a first step, or a preliminary one, before you eventually embark on the journey to recovery.

I can absolutely relate to your obsession with needing to get things done. As I was reading your post at first it spoke to me. I feel as if I am in a constant state of unease, and that anxiety/tension won't go away until everything is perfect. (You write exceptionally well by the way, it helps us understand your mentality intricately, and it doesn't sound insane). To me, your obsession of balance and order is a common human need, albeit the degree of that is severe, but regardless the need is basic. Order, symmetry and the need for balance is something that everyone strives for. The difference is that people interpret that in different ways based on their own life experiences. A lot of my experience and anxiety comes from putting the weight of the world on my shoulders. I feel the pain of my moms depression, my gramma's cancer, my grampa's sadness, my sister's safety, my dad's depression and anger, and I feel as if it is my responsibility to organize and restore order and happiness, even though I don't try nor have I attempted to solve any of those issues - but I still feel that way. I feel like I experience and feel other peoples pain, especially my family's, but not their happiness. This 'disorder' or 'imbalance' has caused my great pain because I equate my individual happiness to everyone's around me. If one is suffering, I can't be happy.

Lately, I have taken an interest in mindfullness and focusing on my diet. I try to meditate (not the typical, cross legged kind - I close my eyes and listen to the flow of a river or a song I really like, and think) as often as I can and I have cut out sugar from my diet completely, in addition to managing my caloric intake. Good thoughts and good food are so important for your health, given they are literally the fuel for your body. Good food helps your body work well physically and focusing on what makes you happy and trying to stay positive gets easier and easier the more work you put into it.

I am currently taking medication and it has helped immensely. Not just because it is working physically, but the fact that I know I'm taking the right steps in bettering myself makes me feel better and happier. It makes me feel like I'm not perennially on 'day one' of my recovery, but that it is a process and I'm in it. Please start taking your medication, it will help, trust me.

I don't know you as a person but I just want you to know that I believe in you. What you shared is incredible; that you have the ability to put in that level of effort to discover yourself (albeit unintentionally or for the wrong reasons) and the extent of your self awareness. Please don't do anything rash. Please don't harm anyone, including yourself. Please contact a professional, including your doctor as they know what to do. You can always PM me but you can get through this. It's the little battles that matter, not the end goal. It always hurts to look at the path ahead rather than looking at all of the minor successes you accomplish a long the way. You can do this.
