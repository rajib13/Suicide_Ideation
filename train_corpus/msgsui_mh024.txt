Constantly frustrated and bored 
This is not a new feeling but lately, these last few months, I've been constantly feeling bored which leads to frustration. It's so irritating holy shit. I could play some video games, or my guitar, work on school stuff, workout and so on but I just can't be bothered. Even if I do something of those or something else I don't feel any different, just feels like a pointless activity, for the most part. This is so draining, everyday life of school and such is already oh so draining and this just makes it worse.
