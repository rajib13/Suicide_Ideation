Do I have a disorder? If so, what do I do about it?
I'm going to try to describe the "abnormal" things about me, because I've been worried for awhile now that I have some sort of disorder. I am an extreme perfectionist, enough that it's hard to take notes in class if I have to write them down quickly because my letters must look right. I also have a problem with procrastination, it's so bad that I commonly stay up until 1 AM working when I only had one assignment and nothing that night. I can't work with others, so group porjects are horrible for me because I don't think anyone will do the job well enough. I also have an extreme fear of embarrassment and rejection, and avoid large group events as I'm afraid I'll mess up and everyone will laugh at me, and I never talk to any girl I like because I'm afraid they'll reject me or I'll embarrass myself. On top of that, I remember random things from months ago that I regret doing, even though no one noticed it and it wasn't weird to them, I constantly bash myself on how stupid I was and imagine if I had just stayed inside alone all day as it would have been better than that. I don't trust other people with my feelings and prefer to just keep everything hidden. Finally, I can't lose an arguement, even if I'm wrong I keep fighting until the other person quits. I hope I didn't forget anything. Just for reference, I'm 15, almost 16, and am in 10th grade of high school. Sorry this was so long, thanks for taking the time to read this, do you think I have any mental disorders of any kind, and if so, what should I do about it?
