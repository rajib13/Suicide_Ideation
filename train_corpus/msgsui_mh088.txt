Collecting Artworks surrounding Mental Health/Eating Disorders for documentary
Hi, We're four Third year film students based at Falmouth University in the process of creating our final film project. Our documentary short seeks to give an insight and raise awareness into the diversity of, and life with an eating disorder. We care deeply about this project as a friendly and sensitive team with past personal experience of eating disorders.

We wondered if anyone in the Reddit community would like to get involved with the project by contributing some form of artistic expression related to mental health.eating disorders i.e poem, drawings, painting ect. Any contribution would be of great value for the project (our doc hopes to be a collage of peoples experiences) and help us portray eating disorders in the best way we can.

We will mention all contributors in the credits unless you would prefer to be anonymous. We have a group email of beefilms123@gmail.com and a facebook page here https://www.facebook.com/HillstartsProduction/?notif_id=1510586687583546&notif_t=page_fan Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, concerns or for more information. Thank you for your time, HillStarts
