I have been considering going for some formal therapy. Any sug-
gestions?
Everyday I feel sad and lonely
Since past sometime I think I am having panic attacks. I really need
help from you guys.
It has been so many years, I feel I still can’t move on. I am noticing
behavior what could be considered “triggers” now.
I know I was never meant to lead this life.
Don’t want to hurt the people I care but I can’t take this anymore.
Today I felt I have nothing left, why am I even living... I don’t see a
point.
I’d kill myself, but the other part of me tells me not to waste all the
money my parents invested on me..
