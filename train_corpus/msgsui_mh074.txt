w do I go about getting weekly therapy appointments?
I have been in therapy on-and-off for almost 6 years, but I've never had it regularly because I thought I didn't need it. I'm approaching my 20th birthday and the more I've grown up, the more I've realized I have some deep-seated issues that I need to work through to have a more stable and happy life. I would like to start having weekly therapy sessions to get through my issues more thoroughly. I need something intense because I've been through a lot of trauma and its time to move on.

Problem is, most therapists can only be seen bi-weekly at best because they are constantly so booked up. I am also looking for a new therapist, someone who is more knowledgable about sex therapy and DBT, so I have a decent amount of options.

How can I get weekly appointments with a therapist, do I just flat out ask and move on if they say no, or is that an impossible request?
Doesn't sound like an impossible request... but is it necessary? It also depends upon how many appointments you can afford, or what your insurance will cover. For example, you might be able to pay for 6 sessions. Do the appointments need to be 7 days apart? I guess you could discuss it with the therapist, but they probably need to do at least 1 appointment with you just to do a basic assessment and see what might help you. 
Not unreasonable at all to check into availability right at the beginning. Personally, I try to make sure all new people are able to see me weekly, if appropriate, and if I'm more busy lately I try to warn anyone incoming that they might have to be biweekly. It's definitely a common thing to meet weekly to really hot the ground running.
