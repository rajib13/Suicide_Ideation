Why do crowds make me feel this way?
So kinda been struggling with this for as long as I can remember but today was bad. I went shopping with my sister today. It was extremely crowded at the mall. I immediately felt annoyed and uncomfortable with that, but I just ignored it. I could enjoy the first three hours of shopping, but when we stepped into the car on our way home, I started feeling off. (Maybe because I let myself feel what I ignored earlier?) When I’m around a lot of people I just feel as if I don’t belong there. I’ve always felt like I was weird and didn’t belong in this world. It’s as if crowds make that realisation even worse and harder on me. It brings me down... a lot. So whilst going home, my mood was going downwards pretty badly. Everything became surrealistic and weird. Everything around me started to make me feel as if I wasn’t supposed to be here. Right after shopping, I went to visit my mom. Somewhere around dinner I started to feel tired although I slept enough the previous night. Just felt ‘out of it’ mostly. Me and her don’t get along to smoothly and she ruined my mood even more. From the moment we stepped in the car after shopping everything just started to feel bad. I felt so lonely and misunderstood when I got home and it made me feel horrible. It all felt so extreme that even my emotions felt surreal. I don’t understand why I’ve always felt this way and it’s so hard to deal with
After a long day in the crowded mall I come home and it’s all quiet now. I feel so out of place in the crowd and I want to get out but when I’m out I feel so lonely again.

It’s normal & what you’re describing isn’t crazy.

Maybe try picking up a hobby or something you enjoy doing alone so then you’ll look forward to leaving the mall.

I hope that makes sense
