Help explain whats happening to me 
I have been having these really strange brain trips, it kind of feels like extreme deja vu or like Im remembering a dream really strongly? But I can't tell if they are real memories or not, when it happens I have this strong feeling like I've got a second life thats happening and these are flashes of it? But then afterwards I know that the memories aren't real. It makes my stomach feel really sick, like when I have a panic attack so I was wondering if maybe it was a version of a panic attack?? I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or if it's normal or just if someone could expand on whats happening to me? TLDR; My brain is doing strange deja vu things increasingly lately, whats going on?
Have been sleeping fine, but i always have had like semi lucid dreaming so my sleep is kind of conscious sleep? Im not on any meds. 
Deja vu is associated with epilepsy. It could be you're having mild non-grand mal seizures. Or the beginning of a seizure disorder.
