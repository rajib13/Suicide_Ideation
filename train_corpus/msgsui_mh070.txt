Antidepressants: the undependable quick fix.
I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. It hurts me that a guy in my class made fun of me by making suicidal jokes. He made a joke about me jumping out a window from one of our faculty buildings. The whole class laughed, but I’m hurt. I’m so hurt. People don’t have any idea how much I’m struggling to keep myself together. I hate them all that laughed. I hate them all!!! 
I'm so sorry that he made that joke and that the class laughed. That was really mean of them, and you don't deserve to deal with that kind of nonsense. Depression is really hard to deal with, and I'm proud of you for pushing through and holding yourself together. Your life is worth so much. 
Fuck those heartless assholes!
