Possible suggestions for a plan of attack
I’m in the process of switching psychiatrists and am more than likely will be changing medications. Do any of you have a general rule that you follow when you go through a medication change? I don’t want to drive people away because I’m adjusting, so any tips would help. 
Double check for yourself that the medications you're taking/will be taking won't interact with each other. I've been put on contraindicated meds twice. The first time was life ruining. The second time I could've damaged my organs or died had I not done a quick Google search after filling the script.

Holding a doctor accountable for hurting you is almost impossible. Make sure it's safe to take what you're taking.
I make sure to ask how they interact with each other and how they effect my other med issues (diabeetus). So I have a few concerns going in.
