I'm pathetic. I've been NEET, living with my mom for 4 years. I feel stuck. So much has happened to me over this period. I've had run-ins with the police. I was put in a psychiatric hospital for a stretch of time. My ex-girlfriend almost strangled me to death. I burned all my bridges. And now, I'm dealing with this fucking disease.

I've been fighting this madness inside my head since March 2016. I call it the "alignment problem". I've had signs of it all my life, but March 2016 was a particularly stressful time for me, and that's when it spiraled out of control.

For context, I've always felt that I'm not fully immersed in the present moment, like there's something I need to finish before I can truly enjoy and experience "now". Imagine you want to unwind, and relax, but you have to finish a work assignment, or a report, and so there's a hanging presence of unfinished business constantly following you around until you finish. That's what I've felt like all my life, like I'm not truly relaxed, because I have something I need to "finish" first.

This thing I need to "finish" has destroyed me. I describe it as an optimization process, or an alignment process. It feels like I have to straighten out my very core, and once I do, I'll be at the forefront of reality, able to live freely and relax without feeling the presence of unfinished business.

In March 2016, when I felt the urge to straighten myself out, I decided for the first time that I'd start work on this unfinished business and align myself as such. When I refer to "alignment", I'm often using the term in a very literal sense. Picture a dark, cavernous space, with a bubble inside it, directly located in the center. That bubble was me. I felt the urge to be fully aligned and symmetrical, in a very literal, visual sense, and if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to move forward with my life.

I'd often lay down in bed and visualize myself in this dark, cavernous space for hours. I needed to remember it at all times. I needed to be centered at all times. These initial visualizations led to a more "intellectualized" approach, where I would actually try to prove I was "in the center".

So it started like this..."in the center"... what does that mean, exactly, and how can I make it true? Eventually, I came to the word "important". If I want to be truly "centered", I have to become the most important person in the Universe. Not for any egotistical reason. Purely for the sake of alignment and symmetry.

So I came up with a list of arbitrary facts about myself and the world, and tried to maneuver them into some "grand truth" about the Universe, so that I could prove my significance and finally become centered. Every part of me knew it was untrue and knew I wasn't universally significant, but I needed it to be true, and I practically FORCED it to be true. For days and days and weeks and months I forced myself to remember every significant fact about myself to "prove" that I was worthy of alignment and symmetry.

After about 3 months of this, my consciousness was fucking rattled, almost to the extent of numerous psychedelic trips. I felt like I was off the planet. Three straight months of forcing untrue drivel into reality by repeating it incessantly to myself. Three straight months of looping thoughts, desperately trying to find my center.

I developed derealization. My moods became incredibly erratic. Paranoia set in. I was no longer on planet Earth.

After this period, I realized I would not be able to align myself this way, by forcing absurd truths into existence. I figured, hey, if I want to center myself, I have to center myself using facts. And so I did. I spent another four months trying to unravel the true nature of reality. I thought if I could understand the world around me, as well as morality, I'd finally be aligned and have strong justification for my actions moving forward.

Four months went by. Another long stretch of time, trying to accomplish the impossible. Trying to answer every question known to man so that I have symmetry in my life. After this, I no longer had anything to "prove". I was just lost. The alignment problem began to seep into every facet of my life, whether it be fitness, speaking with family and friends, organizing my home, literally everything became an issue of symmetry and balance.

Everything needed to be "just right".

It was only in the summer of this year that I started to realize... Maybe there's no solution here. Maybe I'm too far gone. At this point, I'd developed severe delusions, probably stemming from all the months of obsessive thoughts and ruminations.

And so I finally saw a psychiatrist, about a month ago. I'm apparently schizophrenic, which makes sense, but I think there's more to it than that. She prescribed me Risperdal, which I haven't really taken. I'm in a state of chaos right now. It's been nearly two years of repeating thoughts. Fucking "alignment". I can't take it anymore.

Part of me thinks I shouldn't take medication, because if I force myself not to, my mind might accelerate into "overdrive" mode and automatically revert back to normal. I'm desperately hoping for this. I just want to go back to normal.

I don't know why I wrote this post, frankly, but I'm now thinking of killing my ex-girlfriend. I've had thoughts like this before but this time it's real. I want to kill her, film it, and became famous for it. And then maybe I'll kill myself. I can't take these repeating thoughts anymore. I can't do it anymore. Just can't do it. I want it to end.

THAT SAID... I think this would all go away if I could just solve this fucking alignment problem. Maybe it doesn't have to end like this.

I guess what I want to ask is... does this sound like OCD to you? Would antipsychotics even help my situation? Am I so far gone it's not even worth it anymore? I've been awake nearly 36 hours and I'm struggling to see the point of living anymore. I don't know what to do. Please just help me, tell me something that will help me.
