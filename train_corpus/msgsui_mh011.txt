I was prescribed lorazepam (a tranquilizer/benzodiazepine), but I'm trying to withdraw from it.

I took 2.5mg for at least a month.

Decided to drop to 1.25mg. Withdrawal symptoms stopped after 10 days.

Dropped to 0.65mg. Symptoms stopped after more than 2 weeks.

Then I went to my GP and had her prescribe me 1mg pills. I cut them in half, so it's 0.5mg (or less).

On the 4th day of 0.5mg, I started feeling very, very fatigued. I've ever since been yawning much more, and I wake up at nights frequently. I've had some shock-like feelings as well - it felt like my heart was stopping, and I had to jolt myself out of it.

More than 2 weeks in, and I've not had any shock feelings anymore. I've been waking up much less, but I'm still fatigued or sleepy, and yawning much more than normal.

I don't know whether these are withdrawal effects, because the drop in dosage was so low, and I've been on it for at least two weeks now, and it's not getting noticeably better.

Any advice from anyone who's been going through withdrawal as well?

I know about the Ashton Manual. But I've not noticed anything interesting or relating to this there.
