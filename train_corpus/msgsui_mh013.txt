Does anyone else suffer from dissociation?
I feel like it’s never going to stop. What should I do to stop it or at least slow it down? To make matters worse I can’t tell if I’m dissociating right now or if it’s just the comedown from my medication. Just I don’t know help??? I have dissociation as well as dissociative identity disorder. I've had it for around 10 years or so. I can tell you from my experience it comes in waves. It comes and goes. At first I would have dissociation episodes for a long time, for a span of months. Over time it gets better with understanding, and it lasts about 3-4 days when I do get it. I would say to to lessen the symptoms read up on what you have of you haven't done so already, and talk to a therapist and loved ones about what you are going through. My dissociation is usually triggered by certian stresses. Dissociation is basically a survival instinct (to not feel things when on pain and intense situations) but it went wrong somewhere and it comes about in non-dire situations. I feel like once you know what exactly brings it about you will be better at getting through it.
