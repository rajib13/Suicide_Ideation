Family speaking about me without respect. how to assert my feelings and change the situation?
I (23M) have been struggling with my mental health since adolescence. My parents never really cared enough to get me checked out, but I did when I lived on my own at age 18. I moved back in with my father last year after living on my own for a couple of years. He and I havent been in contact for a lot of the time in between. Now he speaks about me being a dirty and stinky in that period and also now. I have trouble working since 2 years but when I do work and earn a little money he is very negative about my work. How do I assert my hurt and rejected feelings and change the conversation?

Yes I do struggle with hygiene and do my best, I also struggle with work and do my best. Of course I have bad spells, but in general I make progress over the months. I think this is pretty normal for a young person who has been living with undiagnosed mental illness for years on end. I am getting diagnosis now

tl, dr: I have been living with undiagnosed mental illness for years, hygiene and work not the best. My father speaks without respect about this and only talks negatively of what is wrong. How do I change the conversation ?
