I honestly just don’t think my friends I’ve been helping out so
much and supporting so much really even care about me. I’ve
been living with my parents since i graduated and they aren’t
happy about it. today i had to deal with being yelled at by each
of them. i have no one and i never felt such pain, i am hurt and
i am alone. Depression and psychosis suck. I’ve been battling these for
many desperate years, turns out, I can’t win, no matter how
hard I try. I’m tired of pretending. I’m tired of making others
happy to forget about my own issues.
