I get itchy when i am alonem always on my bed when im alone. i even thought i was infested by fleas at first. had a gf and never felt itchy with her in my bed, i dont feel itchy outside, at friends house, anywhere else. am i going insane? ive a history of severe panic attacks and been using antidepressants for 2 years now. Anxiety makes me itch too... It's an uncommon anxiety symptom. It's related to CNS overreaction and can actually be a side effect from some meds. Maybe mention it to your doctor? same here i would hurt myself bad by scratching so much. a shower preferably a little cold; helps if it gets bad at least it does for me.
