Not good at socializing but I want to, cant stop playing video games but I want to.
Im watching tv right now and i feel the need to do something. I play videogames all the time since i was little, even though i can be a charismatic guy. Im a college freshman that just got a job, and the games are affecting my grades heavily even before i had a job.

There was a time period where i just couldnt get up in the morning for school, and would totally stop caring. I got over it but that worries me. I play nonstop videogames that i have no other hobbies, and idk how to start getting different hobbies and socialising.

How do I start getting more social/ other things rather than just playing games, when games is all i know?

What i really want is to socialize but all this time being a loner has made me a little not normal when it comes to trying to have a conversation. I hate the why my life is right now but i dont have anything to give my mind a good slap to just change into someone better. Advice?
I'm a gamer too but it took me a long time to realize that I use gaming as a coping mechanism for when I'm feeling down. If I'm not down because of my depression, it's because of the social disasters that happen any time I'm at job. The games are a good escape but I'm still feel like garbage when I do it.

Anyway, I believe that since you have a great desire to change yourself, you'll eventually make it happen. It's only a matter of when and the later you wait the harder it'll be...
My advice would be to try and limit how much you play, then go cold turkey. There is a forum on Reddit (name escapes me) that are guys trying to give up video games.

Although I can not talk my coupling mechanism are tv, books and video games.

Don't have any close friends and prefer not to socialise if I can help it.
