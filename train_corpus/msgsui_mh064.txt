My girlfriend wants to go to my therapy appointments?
I have Bipolar 2, depression, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. My therapist thinks that my girlfriend should come to therapy with me, and my girlfriend wants to come, and is very anxious to come, but I don't really want her to. The thing is, she doesn't know that I have very disturbing thoughts about her. Things that I tell only my therapist. I have them about my family too, and that's the reason that I haven't invited them to go to therapy with me. What would you all say I do? Or should she go to a family group therapy meeting, or should we go to a relationship therapist? Our relationship is working fantastically, but what would you say we should do?
It might be helpful, but it has to be something you actively want to participate in. As someone else commented, ask your therapist what the goal of this would be? You can also set boundaries...what you are and are not okay with having discussed with your girlfriend there. Remember, it’s your therapy session. You are in control and shouldn’t have your privacy violated.

My husband is in treatment for BPD, and I’ve gone to two of his sessions at his request. I’ll never press him to attend them, and I’m completely respectful of the things he chooses to work through privately with his therapist.

Test the waters. If you’re not comfortable, you can always ask that your girlfriend please step out as well so you can chat to your therapist. Hopefully she’d be understanding. In one of the sessions I attended with the hubs, he wanted a few minutes alone towards the end. I went out and got a coffee. No bother.
