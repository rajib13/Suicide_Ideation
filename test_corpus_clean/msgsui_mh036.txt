played unemployment game

locked apartment avoiding ignoring outside world felt living otherwise empty soundstage house nestled spot land floating void

knowing whether anything outside immediate experience existed windows covered possible outside noise drowned nine inch nails–“every exactly same“–i couldn’t close eyes sense life outside house couldn’t sense existence

crossed room wondered world outside moment played quantum rules existent nonexistent pulling back curtain would determine whether world outside even existed hesitated hesitated took certain comfort moment experienced sensation inhabited house trapped infinite void atom nothingness felt relieved somehow comforted

fallen dissociative state existed world problems universe complexities–just relieving silence beautiful silence

sadness emptiness despair consumed

that’s great paradox beautiful dichotomy festers blooms love life hate reject embrace want fear moment dissociative state glanced mortality briefly fantasized death terror seized
