dismissed professionals
hello something happened makes always upset first excuse diagnosis knowing would make worse sick enough sounds stupid keep telling want someone explain whats happening past years keep needing psychological help cant keep studies check always struggles moodthinkinglife affected affected enough thus issue therapist even assumed going life okay made breakdown affecting life enough cant keep friendships zero life

mean know diagnosis isnt magic badge youre cured neither want diagnosis answer keep going back struggle matter knowing would help could understand know years therapy years struggling kinda want know suspicions dont want selfdiagnose course tell find seems never

anyone gone doctors dismissing years struggles helped

anyone asks cant therapist possible money parents wouldnt could also seeing public system cant others public system following workbook therapy sessions arent many early helping
little background temporary diagnosis schizophreniform disorder psychiatric hospital years even psychiatrist said reassessed went remission things could change refused giving diagnosis ignored symptoms discussed pretty
well different ones it’s worth shot call really want info what’s going records paper filed away maybe even copied definitely suggest nothing lose good luck hope better therapist willing discuss mental health future deserve symptom mentioned wasnt hallucinations nothing stopped seeing psychiatrist close years
first month said schizophreniform know discharge papers psychiatric hospital thatd mean call hospital rather memories plus hard speak phone anyone parents feel okay also never therapy hospital anything beside minutes week medication doubt much information think though thank never know opportunities come yeah hope hopes small hahaha
